Approximately three billion individuals are exposed to household air pollution  from the burning of biomass fuels worldwide.
Household air pollution is responsible for 2.9 million annual deaths and causes significant health, economic and social consequences, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.
Although there is biological plausibility to draw an association between HAP exposure and respiratory diseases, existing evidence is either lacking or conflicting.
We abstracted systematic reviews and meta-analyses for summaries available for common respiratory diseases in any age group and performed a literature search to complement these reviews with newly published studies.
Based on the literature summarized in this review, HAP exposure has been associated with acute respiratory infections, tuberculosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumoconiosis, head and neck cancers, and lung cancer.
No study, however, has established a causal link between HAP exposure and respiratory disease.
Furthermore, few studies have controlled for tobacco smoke exposure and outdoor air pollution.
More studies with consistent diagnostic criteria and exposure monitoring are needed to accurately document the association between  exposure and respiratory disease.
Better environmental exposure monitoring is critical to better separate the contributions of household air pollution from that of other exposures, including ambient air pollution and tobacco smoking.
Clinicians should be aware that patients with current or past HAP exposure are at increased risk for respiratory diseases or malignancies and may want to consider earlier screening in this population.
