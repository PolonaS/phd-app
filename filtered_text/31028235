 (NRD), as reflected by change in parasternal muscle electromyogram (EMGpara), predicts clinical deterioration and safe discharge in patients admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of COPD .
The clinical utility of NRD to predict the long-term outcome of patients following hospital admission with an AECOPD is unknown.
We undertook a post hoc analysis of a previously published prospective observational cohort study measuring NRD in 120 patients with AECOPD.
Sixty-nine (57.5%) patients died during follow-up (median 3.6 years).
Respiratory failure was the most common cause of death (n=29; 42%).
In multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with an increased mortality included NRD (HR 2.14, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.54, p=0.003), age (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.34, p=0.006), PaCO
