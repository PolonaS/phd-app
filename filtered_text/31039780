Although feelings of anxiety and depression are common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , little is known about the estimates of their incidence in patients with asthma-COPD overlap , which has been described and acknowledged as a distinct clinical entity.
We aimed to estimate the risk of depression and anxiety among patients with ACO and compare it with the risk among those with COPD alone in the general population.
We conducted a nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study using the Korean National Sample Cohort database between 1 January, 2002, and 31 December, 2013.
Patients who were diagnosed with COPD (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10] codes J42-J44) at least twice and prescribed COPD medications at least once between 2003 and 2011 were classified into two categories: patients who were diagnosed with asthma (ICD-10 codes J45-J46) more than twice and at least once prescribed asthma medications comprised the ACO group, and the remaining COPD patients comprised the COPD alone group.
Patients who had been diagnosed with depression or anxiety within a year before the index date were excluded.
We defined the outcome as time to first diagnosis with depression and anxiety.
Matched Cox regression models were used to compare the risk of depression and anxiety among patients with ACO and patients with COPD alone after propensity score matching with a 1:1 ratio.
After propensity score estimation and matching in a 1:1 ratio, the cohort used in the analysis included 15,644 patients.
The risk of depression during the entire study period was higher for patients with ACO than for patients with COPD alone (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.18; P value = 0.0039), with an elevated risk in patients aged 40-64 years (1.21; 1.10-1.34; 0.0001) and in women (1.18; 1.07-1.29; 0.0005).
The risk of anxiety was higher for patients with ACO than for patients with COPD alone (1.06; 1.01-1.12; 0.0272), with a higher risk in patients aged 40-64 years (1.08; 1.00-1.17; 0.0392); however, the risk was not significant when stratified by sex.
This population-based study revealed a higher incidence of depression and anxiety in patients with ACO than in patients with COPD alone.
