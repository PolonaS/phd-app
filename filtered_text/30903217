The Ligament Augmentation and Reconstruction System (LARS
Results of a single surgeon's entire cohort of 55 patients who underwent primary LARS ACL surgery were reviewed at a median of 7.8 years (6.0-9.4).
Patient-reported outcome measures including the International Knee Documentation Committee  score and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were collected and clinical assessment consisted of range of motion  and the KT-1000 arthrometer to assess the side-side difference in the operative and non-operative knee.
Mechanical failures of the graft were confirmed at revision surgery and a survivorship analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
The overall mechanical failure rate was 17/51 (33.3%) with ruptures occurring at a median 3.9 years (0.6-8.8 years) following primary LARS ACL surgery.
Secondary operative procedures were performed in 39.2% of patients.
For intact grafts, there was no statistically significant difference is side-to-side ROM or anterior knee laxity and subjective scores revealed a median IKDC subjective score of 85.1 (26.4-100) and SF-36 physical component score of 94.1.
The rates of LARS ACL construct failure (33.3%) in this cohort are high and based on these results the LARS should not be considered as a graft option for primary ACL reconstruction.
