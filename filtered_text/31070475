Health effects attributable to short-term and long-term ambient air pollution (AAP) exposure in Indian population are less understood.
This study evaluates the effect of short time and long-term exposure to AAP on respiratory morbidity, mortality and premature mortality for the exposed population.
A total of 59 studies are reviewed to examine the effects of short-term exposure (n = 23); long-term exposure (n = 18) and premature mortality (n = 18).
Short-term exposures to ambient pollutants have strong associations between COPD, respiratory illnesses and higher rates of hospital admission or visit.
The long-term effects of AAP, associated with deficit lung function, asthma, heart attack, cardiovascular mortality and premature mortality have received much attention.
