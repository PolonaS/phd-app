The gracilis tendon is commonly used as an autograft to reconstruct torn tendons or ligaments in many parts of the body.
Little is known about the subjective and functional outcome after gracilis tendon harvest.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of the donor leg in patients undergoing such surgery.
Patients with chronic acromioclavicular joint dislocations undergoing coracoclavicular ligament reconstructions using autogenous gracilis tendon grafts were eligible for this study.
The graft harvesting procedure was carried out in a standard fashion using a tendon stripper.
 (KOOS) were collected preoperatively and after 12 months.
The first 5 patients were included retrospectively and lacked preoperative data, for these patients age- and gender matched normative KOOS scores were used as baseline values.
Isometric knee flexor strength in 60° and 90° degrees of flexion was measured at final follow up at a median of 26 (14-56) months postoperatively with the non-operated leg used as reference.
Twenty four patients were eligible for the study and 2 were excluded.
The 22 patients available for analysis had a mean age of 44 (22-62) years at the time of surgery and 4 were women.
There was no statistically significant change in KOOS 12 months postoperatively compared to baseline values but the patients were weaker in knee flexion in the operated leg compared to the non-operated one.
Gracilis tendon harvesting results in a weakness of knee flexion but does not impair subjective knee function and is a procedure that can be recommended when an autogenous tendon graft is needed.
