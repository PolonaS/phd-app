The internal brace is a ligament repair bridging concept using braided ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene suture tape and knotless bone anchors to reinforce ligament strength to allow early mobilization during early-phase healing.
This concept can be used in the management of anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, anterolateral ligament, medial collateral ligament, posteromedial corner, and posterolateral corner injuries.
Ligament reinforcement is a concept in which a graft is reinforced and can be used in all aspects of knee ligament reconstruction.
There has been a recent resurgence in ligament repair and recent evidence suggests equivalent outcome results.
