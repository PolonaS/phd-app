Knowing the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  that increase the physical activity of daily living  after pulmonary rehabilitation  is a challenge.
to compare baseline characteristics between patients who achieved and failed to achieve the minimal important difference  of PADL post-PR; to verify which baseline variables better predict the change and identify a cut-off point to discriminate MID achievers.
Fifty-three patients with COPD (FEV
The MID achievers presented lower FEV
Patients with worse lung function, functional capacity and lower PADL level before PR are those that improve the PADL level.
EE walking and time on PADL<1.5MET better predict this change.
The cut-off point of 6525 steps can help to identify patients with higher chances of improving the PADL level.
