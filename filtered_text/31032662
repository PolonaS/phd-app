The relationship of body mass index  with lung function and COPD has been previously described in several high-income settings.
However, few studies have examined this relationship in resource-limited settings where being underweight is more common.
We evaluated the association between BMI and lung function outcomes across 14 diverse low- and middle-income countries.
We included data from 12,396 participants aged 35-95 years and used multivariable regressions to assess the relationship between BMI with either COPD and lung function while adjusting for known risk factors.
An inflection point was observed at a BMI of 19.8â€‰kg/m
