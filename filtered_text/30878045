The multiple ligament injured knee is a complex biomechanical environment.
When primary stabilizers fail, secondary stabilizers have an increased role.
In addition, loss of primary restraints puts undue stress on the remaining intact structures of the knee.
Treatment of these injuries requires accurate diagnosis of all injured structures, and careful consideration of repairs and reconstructions that restore the synergistic stability of all ligaments in the knee.
