Overuse injuries of the extensor mechanism of the knee are common in both athletes and non-athletes and usually occur during activities associated with repetitive loading, stress, and knee extension.
Historically, they have been labeled as Jumper's knee due to the high prevalence seen in the athletic community.
In many published reports, the name "patellar tendinopathy" is used to describe this disorder of the quadriceps tendon at the patellar insertion, and the names are often used interchangeably.
Numerous reports have been published describing extensor mechanism injuries in athletes, but there is a paucity of studies that focus on quadriceps tendinopathy.
In addition, there is no universally accepted classification system for tendon pathology.
Therefore, we performed a comprehensive literature review of these studies.
This review consists of 2 parts.
In the first part we review: (I) epidemiology and (II) diagnosis of quadriceps tendinopathy in the athlete as well as the general population.
In the second part we discuss: (I) classification; (II) prognosis; and (III) treatment results.
