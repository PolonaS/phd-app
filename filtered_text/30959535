After the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, a loss of proprioception is observed and it can continue years after the operation.
The aim of this study is to evaluate proprioception in standing position at different knee flexion angles in patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with tibialis anterior tendon allograft.
The study included 34 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with tibialis anterior tendon allograft and 34 healthy individuals.
Proprioception was evaluated in standing position at 15°, 30°, 60° flexion angles with the active joint position sense (AJPS) method using digital inclinometer.
Proprioception deviation angle was found to be higher in the operated leg at 30° and 60° flexion angles in the patient group compared with the other leg (
