In sports physiotherapy, medicine and orthopaedic  (RCT), the investigators (and readers) focus on the difference between groups in change scores from baseline to follow-up.
Mean score changes are difficult to interpret ('is an improvement of 20 units good?
'), and follow-up scores may be more meaningful.
We investigated how applying three different responder criteria to change and follow-up scores would affect the 'outcome' of RCTs.
Responder criteria refers to participants' perceptions of how the intervention affected them.
We applied three different criteria-minimal important change (MIC), patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) and treatment failure (TF)-to the aggregate Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS
MIC: At 2 years, more than 90% in the two treatment arms reported themselves to be minimally but importantly improved for the primary outcome KOOS
We applied change criteria as well as cross-sectional follow-up criteria to interpret trial outcomes with more clinical focus.
We suggest researchers apply MIC, PASS and TF thresholds to enhance interpretation of KOOS and other patient-reported scores.
The findings from this study can improve shared decision-making processes for people with an acute ACL injury.
