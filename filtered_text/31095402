Cell-based cartilage repair performed as a single-stage procedure is an important advancement in the treatment of full-thickness cartilage injury and has potential for widespread clinical use.
To investigate the long-term clinical outcomes of cartilage repair in the knee with a hyaluronic acid-based scaffold embedded with bone marrow aspirate concentrate  for the treatment of full-thickness cartilage injury.
Case series; Level of evidence, 4.
Patients underwent treatment of full-thickness chondral injury in the knee with HA-BMAC and were followed prospectively for a minimum of 6 years.
Clinical outcomes were examined with patient-reported scoring instruments that consisted of the Tegner Activity Scale, International Knee Documentation Committee  subjective score, visual analog scale, and  (KOOS).
Comparative analysis of pre- and postoperative scores was performed, and the effects of patient age, body mass index, lesion size, number of treated lesions, and concurrent treatment with associated procedures were examined.
Twenty-three patients (mean age, 48.5 years) were followed prospectively for a mean 8 years (range, 6-10 years).
Median cartilage lesion size was 6.5 cm
Repair of full-thickness cartilage injury in the knee with a HA-BMAC provides good to excellent clinical outcomes at long-term follow-up in the treatment of small to large lesions.
Cartilage repair with HA-BMAC leads to comparatively successful long-term outcomes in the treatment of small or large lesions, single or multiple lesions, and lesions in 1 or 2 compartments, as well as in cases of associated lesion treatment.
While good outcomes can be expected among treated patients >45 years of age, outcomes may be comparatively more successful in younger patients.
