There has been a renewed interest in anterior cruciate ligament  repairs over the last decade with some early promising results in the right patient population.
Additionally, the anterolateral ligament has been extensively studied and has recently been shown to have a protective effect on standard ACL reconstructions in a clinical trial.
Given its protective effect on ACL reconstructions, we believe this phenomenon is also relevant to ACL repairs and can decrease rerupture rates.
In this publication, we demonstrate a surgical technique for ACL repair using an internal brace combined with an anterolateral ligament reconstruction using a gracilis autograft.
