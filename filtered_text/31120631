As explained in the methods-section, we chose to analyze the 2-year data in regard to inflammatory activity based on MRI and synovial biomarkers (and not earlier time points) as our aim was to capture patients that experienced "prolonged" or chronic inflammation, which may be regarded as a potential risk factor for osteoarthritis  development.
Virtually all patients of an acute injury cohort (like the KANON patients) will exhibit acute post-traumatic inflammation in their injured knee to a various extent as manifested by marked changes on imaging (i.e.
effusion, traumatic synovitis and haemarthrosis) or in biochemical parameters.
