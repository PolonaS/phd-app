Recently, it has been shown in the murine model that platelet maturation takes place, to some extent, in the lungs.
The extrapolation of these findings to humans leads to the possibility that chronic lung diseases could affect platelet maturation and, consequently, the platelet count.
The aim of this study was to investigate whether there are changes in the platelet count in patients with chronic obstructive disease (COPD).
The study included 44 patients, aged 66.5 ± 5.5 years, in stage II-IV COPD.
The control group consisted of 48 age- and gender-matched patients without any respiratory diseases.
We failed to find a significant difference in the platelet count between the two groups: 231 ± 80 vs. 223 ± 63 x 10
