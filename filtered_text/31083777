Non-invasive ventilation  is part of the standard of care for hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to COPD, but may be poorly tolerated.
Preliminary evidence suggests  (NHF) therapy may improve hypercapnia in COPD and be well tolerated.
We compared NHF and NIV in people with COPD and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure.
Single-blind randomized controlled two-way cross-over single-centre trial was conducted in New Zealand.
Twenty-four participants with stable hypercapnic COPD received: NHF at 45â€‰L/min and NIV at 15/4 cm H
NIV reduced the PtCO
In stable COPD patients with chronic hypercapnia, NIV resulted in a greater reduction in PtCO
