Simultaneous occurrence of tibial tubercle fracture and patellar tendon avulsion is an extremely rare condition.
However, they have become more frequent due to increased participation in sports at a younger age.
Diagnosis is not always straightforward, and treatment consists of open reduction and internal fixation.
Only a few case reports of such injuries were reported in the literature with limited information according to diagnoses, treatment, and outcome in adolescents.
