The quadriceps tendon is a versatile graft option, and the clinical implications of a quadriceps tendon harvest need to be further defined.
To review surgical considerations for the safe harvest of a quadriceps tendon autograft for  (ACL) reconstruction, with a focus on the risk of patellar fractures.
Case series; Level of evidence, 4.
A series of 57 patients underwent ACL reconstruction with a quadriceps tendon autograft with a patellar bone block from March 2011 to December 2012 at a single institution.
Patients who sustained a patellar fracture were identified.
The clinical course for each patient was reviewed with  (IKDC) subjective knee form scores through 2-year follow-up.
The incidence of patellar fractures was 3.5% intraoperatively and 8.8% at 2 years.
This included 2 intraoperative fractures, 1 fracture during strength testing, and 2 occult fractures detected on  (CT) performed 6 months postoperatively for research purposes in asymptomatic participants.
For the 5 patients with a patellar fracture with 24-month follow-up, the IKDC scores were 91.95, 91.95, 100.00, 100.00, and 64.37.
Careful consideration of the quadriceps tendon and patellar anatomy is needed to safely harvest the bone plug from the superior pole of the patella.
The consequences of a quadriceps tendon autograft harvest, specifically with regard to the risks associated with fractures of the patella during the harvest, demand full consideration.
Postoperative imaging with CT may identify abnormalities in patients who are otherwise asymptomatic.
