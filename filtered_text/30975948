This study aimed to determine the relationship between pain of  (OA) and  (BMI), age, pain control strategy, self-efficacy for pain control, exercise, and functional activities in a cohort of Iranian women.
In total, 150 women with advanced knee OA, candidates for arthroplasty in Tabriz, in the Northwest of Iran were enrolled into the study.
A convenience sampling method was used, and data was collected using demographic form, short-form McGill pain questionnaire, pain self-efficacy questionnaire, self-efficacy for exercise, and functional activities scales.
The present pain intensity of 74.7% of women was described as excruciating with mean (±SD) score 9.58 (±0.77) in the visual analogue scale.
The majority of the women had a low self-efficacy for pain, exercise, and functional activities with means of 31.8, 17.28, and 57.63 respectively.
There was a significant inverse relationship between sensory and affective components of pain and self-efficacy for pain control and functional activities (P < 0.001).
The sensory and affective components of pain was related to age (P < 0.05), pain control self-efficacy (P < 0.01), and BMI (P < 0.05).
A great majority of the women (79.33%) used complementary medicine  for pain management.
Those who used CM reported lower pain and higher self-efficacy (P < 0.01).
The findings of this study suggest that life style modification and pain management education of women with OA and nurses on non-pharmacological interventions as well as integration of these into nursing care is essential.
