Systemic lupus erythematosus  is an immune disease characterized by multiorgan involvement.
Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus  is one of the most devastating complications of SLE, which lacks efficient diagnostic biomarkers.
The recent studies on the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies suggested its potential pathogenic roles in NPSLE.
However, the clinical relevance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE is still elusive.
In this study, we sought to determine the serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in patients with SLE to investigate the clinical significance of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies in SLE.
Concentrations of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase autoantibodies (anti-GAPDH autoantibodies) in the serum of 130 SLE patients and 55 healthy individuals were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
Among the 130 SLE patients, 95 were SLE patients without neuropsychiatric symptoms and 35 had NPSLE.

The serum levels of the anti-GAPDH autoantibodies were significantly elevated in the SLE patients, especially in the patients with NPSLE (
Serum anti-GAPDH autoantibody was increased in both groups of SLE patients with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms and associated with disease severity.
It could become an indicator of tissue damages in the brain for the future clinical practice.
