Women after anterior cruciate ligament  injury and ACL reconstruction  are more likely than men to exhibit asymmetric movement patterns, which are associated with post-traumatic osteoarthritis.
We developed the  (ACL-SPORTS) randomized control trial to test the effect of strength, agility, plyometric, and secondary prevention (SAPP) training with and without perturbation training (SAPP + PERT) on gait mechanics in women after ACLR.
We hypothesized that movement symmetry would improve over time across both groups but more so among the SAPP + PERT group.
Thirty-nine female athletes 3-9 months after primary ACLR were randomized to SAPP or SAPP + PERT training.
Biomechanical testing during overground walking occurred before (Pre-training) and after (Post-training) training and one and 2 years post-operatively.
Hip and knee kinematic and kinetic variables were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni corrections for post hoc comparisons (α = 0.05).
There was a time by limb interaction effect (p = 0.028) for  (PKFA), the primary outcome which powered the study, characterized by smaller PKFA in the involved compared to uninvolved limbs across treatment groups at Pre-training, Post-training, and 1 year, but not 2 years.
Similar findings occurred across sagittal plane knee excursions and kinetics and hip extension excursion at midstance.
There were no meaningful interactions involving group.
Neither SAPP nor SAPP + PERT training improved walking mechanics, which persisted 1 but not 2 years after ACLR.
Statement of clinical significance: Asymmetrical movement patterns persisted long after participants achieved symmetrical strength and functional performance, suggesting more time is needed to recover fully after ACLR.
