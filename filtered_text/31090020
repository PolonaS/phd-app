Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  is a common comorbidity of  (NSCLC).
COPD is characterized by systemic inflammation and lymphocyte dysfunction, mechanisms that are also known to accelerate progression of advanced (IIIB-IV) stage NSCLC.
We aimed to find out whether COPD exerts an influence on tumor induced inflammatory and lymphoid responses and progression-free survival  after first-line treatment in advanced NSCLC.
Patients suffering from NSCLC (n = 95), COPD (n = 54), NSCLC+COPD (n = 80) and healthy controls (n = 60) were included.
PFS, neutrophil granulocyte and lymphocyte cell counts were recorded.
Serum IFNγ, TNFα, VEGF concentrations were measured by using multiplex cytometric bead-based immunoassay.
Prevalence of myeloid-derived suppressor cell populations , and signs of T cell exhaustion were tested by using flow cytometry.
Median PFS increased in the NSCLC+COPD group compared to NSCLC patients without COPD (7.4 vs 4.9 months, p < 0.01).
NSCLC+COPD patients had 1.7 times (1.2-2.4) more likely to have longer PFS compared to NSCLC patients without COPD (Cox analysis, p < 0.01).
Neutrophil cell counts, CRP, IFNγ and TNFα concentrations were all reduced in NSCLC+COPD (all p < 0.05 vs NSCLC).
NSCLC+COPD was also associated with reduced serum IL-10 concentration and increased granzyme-B positive CD8 cell counts compared to NSCLC without COPD.
The effects of VEGF and MDSC-s on systemic inflammation appeared to be blunted by COPD in patients suffering from advanced NSCLC.
Concomitant COPD moderates tumor-induced inflammation and supports some effector lymphoid functions and thereby may be an independent positive predictive factor of longer PFS after first-line therapy in advanced NSCLC.
