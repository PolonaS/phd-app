Anatomic tunnel formation and remnant preservation are valuable aspects of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.
However, anatomic landmarks are difficult to observe during remnant-preserving ACL reconstruction (ACLR).
The aims of this study were to evaluate the: 1) femoral tunnel location created with guidance from the apex of the deep cartilage margin (ADC) and footprint compared to anatomical reference; and 2) relationship between femoral tunnel location and outcomes of ACLR.
A total of 109 ACLR patients without revision ACLR, multi-ligament reconstruction, peri-knee fracture, and osteotomy were included.
The femoral tunnel was formed at the most proximal corner of the femoral footprint using a posterior trans-septal portal as the viewing portal.
The distance from the tunnel center to ADC was measured by computed tomography and arthroscopy.
The two measurements were then compared.
Finally, femoral tunnel location was compared to the anatomic reference and correlated with the outcomes.
The average distance from ADC to the femoral tunnel center was 7.0 ± 1.4 mm as measured by arthroscopy, and 7.2 ± 2.0 mm using three-dimensional computed tomography.
There was no statistically significant difference between the two methods (P = 0.420).
Clinical and stability outcomes were significantly improved postoperatively.
Clinical outcome was not related to femoral tunnel location; however, stability outcome was related to femoral tunnel location: the more proximally located femoral tunnels showed better stability.
The ADC can be a possible landmark in remnant-preserving ACLR using a trans-septal portal.
A more proximal femoral tunnel, which is located at the proximal corner of the ACL remnant, can provide stability advantage during remnant-preserving ACLR.
