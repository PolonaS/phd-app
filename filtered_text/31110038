Noninvasive respiratory support at the end of life is controversial, although it is becoming increasingly common.
Supplemental oxygen is widely prescribed for palliative care and may help with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Noninvasive ventilation has a well-established evidence-based role in the management of respiratory failure due to exacerbations of COPD and cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
However, its role during palliative care is unclear, and evidence of support is limited.
High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy is a new strategy for which there is evidence to support its use for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
However, any benefit of the use of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy in the palliative setting is unknown at this time.
This review examined evidence relating to the use of noninvasive respiratory support at the end of life.
