Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 and -9 released by degranulating polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) promote pericellular proteolysis by binding to PMN surfaces in a catalytically active tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-resistant forms.
The PMN receptor(s) to which MMP-8 and MMP-9 bind(s) is not known.
Competitive binding experiments showed that Mmp-8 and Mmp-9 share binding sites on murine PMN surfaces.
A novel form of TIMP-1 (an inhibitor of soluble MMPs) is rapidly expressed on PMN surfaces when human PMNs are activated.
Membrane-bound TIMP-1 is the PMN receptor for pro- and active MMP-8 and -9 as shown by the following: 1) TIMP-1 is strikingly colocalized with MMP-8 and -9 on activated human PMN surfaces and in PMN extracellular traps; 2) minimal immunoreactive and active Mmp-8 or Mmp-9 are detected on the surface of activated
