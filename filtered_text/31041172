The rate of decline in lung function in  (COPD) patients showed more profound decline than normal individuals.
However, a 1-year lung function among Indonesian patients with COPD has not been elucidated.
This study attempted to determine the rate of lung function decline in terms of obstruction variable among COPD patients after a 1-year of treatment.
This retrospective cohort study measures the rate of decline in  (FEV1) and ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity  in COPD patients at COPD Outpatient Clinic Persahabatan Hospital after 1-year of treatment.
There were 31 COPD patients with the prevalence of 1-year declined FEV1 and FEV1/FVC which were 83.9% and 51.6%, respectively.
Among 1-year declined lung function group, there were significant (
Most patients had statistically significant rate of decline in FEV1 and FEV1/FVC within 1-year of COPD treatment.
This study recognized an unfavorable prognosis in terms of irreversible deteriorating lung function of COPD patients despite therapeutic management.
