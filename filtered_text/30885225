The infrapatellar fat pad  of the knee joint has received lots of attention recently due to its emerging role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis , where it displays an inflammatory phenotype.
The aim of the present study was to examine the infrapatellar fatty acid  composition in a rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) model of early OA created by anterior cruciate ligament transection .
OA was induced randomly in the left or right knee joint of skeletally mature New Zealand White rabbits by ACLT, while the contralateral knee was left intact.
A separate group of unoperated rabbits served as controls.
The IFP of the ACLT, contralateral, and control knees were harvested following euthanasia 2 or 8 weeks post-ACLT and their FA composition was determined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
The n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated FA  ratio shifted in a pro-inflammatory direction after ACLT, already observed 2 weeks after the operation (0.20 ± 0.008 vs. 0.18 ± 0.009).
At 8 weeks, the FA profile of the ACLT group was characterized with increased percentages of 20:4n-6 (0.44 ± 0.064 vs. 0.98 ± 0.339 mol-%) and 22:6n-3 (0.03 ± 0.014 vs. 0.07 ± 0.015 mol-%) and with decreased  (MUFA) sums (37.19 ± 1.586 vs. 33.20 ± 1.068 mol-%) and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios (0.20 ± 0.008 vs. 0.17 ± 0.008).
The FA signature of the contralateral knees resembled that of the unoperated controls in most aspects, but had increased proportions of total n-3 PUFA and reduced MUFA sums.
These findings provide novel information on the effects of early OA on the infrapatellar FA profile in the rabbit ACLT model.
The reduction in the n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio of the IFP is in concordance with the inflammation and cartilage degradation in early OA and could contribute to disease pathogenesis.
