Historically, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  has been considered to affect mostly older men with a history of smoking; however, in recent times, its prevalence and mortality rates have steadily increased among women.
To systematically assess differences in COPD expression between women and men in UK primary care clinics who were newly diagnosed with COPD.
This retrospective cohort study compared women and men with an incident diagnosis of COPD, using electronic medical records data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and linked Hospital Episode Statistics data.
The overall study period was between 1 January 2006 and 28 February 2016; patients with an incident diagnosis of COPD between 1 January 2010 and 28 February 2015 were analysed.
A cohort of 22,429 patients were identified as incident patients and included in the study; 48% of patients with COPD were women.
The risk of first moderate or severe exacerbation was 17% greater in women than in men (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.23), with a median time-to-first exacerbation of 504 days for women and 637 days for men.
These differences were more prominent in the younger age group (â‰¥40 to <65 years), as well as in GOLD 2016 groups B, C and D and in individuals with moderate-to-severe airflow obstruction.
The annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was higher in women compared with men in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd year of follow-up.
These results highlight the unmet need for appropriate identification and management of women with COPD in clinical practice.
