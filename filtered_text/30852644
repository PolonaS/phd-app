Quadriceps muscle dysfunction is common following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction .
Data considering the diversity of neural changes, in-concert with morphological adaptations of the quadriceps muscle, are lacking.
We investigated bilateral differences in neural and morphological characteristics of the quadriceps muscle in ACLR participants (n = 11, month post-surgery: 69.4 ± 22.4) compared to controls matched by sex, age, height, weight, limb dominance, and activity level.
Spinal reflex excitability was assessed using Hoffmann reflexes (H:M); corticospinal excitability was quantified via  (AMT) and  (MEP) using transcranial magnetic stimulation.
Cortical activation was assessed using a knee flexion/extension task with  (fMRI).
Muscle volume was quantified using structural MRI.
Muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes were also collected.
2 × 2 RM ANOVAs were used to evaluate group differences.
Smaller quadriceps muscle volume (total volume, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and intermedius) and lower strength were detected compared to contralateral and control limbs.
Individuals with ACLR reported higher levels of pain and fear and lower levels of knee function compared to controls.
No differences were observed for H:M. ACLR individuals demonstrated higher AMT bilaterally and smaller MEPs in the injured limb, compared to the controls.
ACLR participants demonstrated greater activation in frontal lobe areas responsible for motor and pain processing compared to controls, which were associated with self-reported pain.
Our results suggest that individuals with ACLR demonstrate systemic neural differences compared to controls, which are observed concurrently with smaller quadriceps muscle volume, quadriceps muscle weakness, and self-reported dysfunction.
