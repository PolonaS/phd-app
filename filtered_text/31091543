Using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function (PROMIS PF) computerized adaptive test instead of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS, JR) could reduce question burden for patients with knee pain.
We aimed to prospectively determine the correlation between PROMIS PF and KOOS, JR to assess whether PROMIS PF could be a useful alternative measure for both research and clinical care of patients with knee pain.
This was a cross-sectional study of 88 patients.
We assessed the correlation between PROMIS PF and KOOS, JR using a Pearson's correlation test.
Two multivariable linear regression models were used to determine the amount of variation explained by various patient-level factors.
There was a strong correlation between PROMIS PF and KOOS, JR (
