The study purpose is to characterize the sizes of the anterior cruciate ligament  insertion site and intercondylar notch in Chinese patients undergoing ACL surgery.
The findings will provide a reference for individualized clinical treatment of ACL rupture.
For this study, 137 patients (102 males, 35 females) with an average age of 30.3 ± 9.5 years (range 14-52 years) undergoing ACL reconstruction were included.
The tibial ACL insertion site length and width and the intercondylar notch width were measured on MRI and arthroscopically using a ruler.
Descriptive statistics of the patients, the distribution of the measurements and the differences between males and females were calculated.
The ACL tibial insertion size and intercondylar notch width in Chinese patients with ACL injuries, as obtained by MRI and intra-operatively, exhibited significant individual variability.
The tibial ACL insertion site had a mean length of 13.5 ± 2.1 mm and width of 10.9 ± 1.5 mm as measured on MRI and a mean length of 13.3 ± 2.1 mm and width of 11.0 ± 1.6 mm as measured intra-operatively.
The mean intercondylar notch width was 15.2 ± 2.4 mm on MRI and the mean length was 15.0 ± 2.5 mm intra-operatively.
The inter-rater reliability between MRI and intra-operative measurements confirmed that the two methods were consistent.
In 65.7% of individuals, the ACL tibial insertion length was < 14 mm.
The distribution of tibial footprint size in Chinese patients is different from that in Western populations.
There is a higher proportion of subjects with a tibial footprint size < 14 mm among Chinese patients with ACL injury.
Therefore, great care should be taken when treating this population with the double-bundle technique or larger graft options.
Level of evidence IV.
