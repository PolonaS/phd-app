The diagnosis and management of combined  (ACL) and  (MCL) injuries have been a controversial topic for several decades.
No single approach has proven optimal for treatment and there is no consensus between most specialists.
This review seeks to describe and clarify the current state and the future of management.
Most authors agree on reconstructing of the ACL with non-operative management of the MCL in grade I and II injuries, respectively.
However, controversy still exists about the optimal method of treating a combined ACL with higher grade MCL injuries.
Management should be customized based on acuity, injury grade, and specific goals for each patient.
Future research with clinical outcomes may facilitate creating guidelines to optimize recovery.
