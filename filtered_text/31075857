Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory airway disease punctuated by exacerbations (AECOPD).
Subjects with frequent AECOPD, defined by having at least two exacerbations per year, experience accelerated loss of lung function, deterioration in quality of life and increase in mortality.
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)23, a hormone associated with systemic inflammation and altered metabolism is elevated in COPD.
However, associations between FGF23 and AECOPD are unknown.
In this cross-sectional study, individuals with COPD were enrolled between June 2016 and December 2016.
Plasma samples were analyzed for intact FGF23 levels.
Logistic regression analyses were used to measure associations between clinical variables, FGF23, and the frequent exacerbator phenotype.
Our results showed that FGF23 levels were higher in frequent exacerbators as compared to patients without frequent exacerbations.
FGF23 was also independently associated with frequent exacerbations (OR 1.02; 95%CI 1.004-1.04;
