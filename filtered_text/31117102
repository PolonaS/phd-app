Endoscopic lung volume reduction using ZephyrÂ® valves has been recently adopted as a treatment option for patients with severe emphysema without collateral ventilation .
To assess the efficacy and safety of Zephyr valves in such a population.
Studies were identified from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases.
All searches were current until June 2018.
We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials  evaluating the efficacy and safety of Zephyr.
We defined as outcome: change in  (FEV1), in the  (6MWT), in the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire , and in  (RV).
Safety analysis included  (RR) of pneumothorax.
We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.
7 RCTs reported on Zephyr valves and 5 RCTs included only patients without CV.
Zephyr improved FEV1 with a mean difference  of 17.36% (CI, 9.28-25.45, I2 = 78%).
Subgroup analysis showed significant FEV1 improvement following Zephyr placement in patients with heterogeneous distribution: MD = 21.78% (CI, 8.70-34.86, I2 = 89%) and 16.27% (CI, 8.78-23.76, I2 = 0%) in patients with homogeneous emphysema.
Studies with a follow-up of 3 months reported FEV1 MD = 17.19% (CI, 3.16-31.22, I2 = 89%) compared to studies with a follow-up of 6-12 months, which showed a consistent improvement of FEV1 MD = 17.90% (CI, 11.47-24.33, I2 = 0%).
Zephyr also showed improvement of SGRQ, 6MWT, and RV.
RR of pneumothorax was 6.32 (CI, 3.74-10.67, I2 = 0%).
In this population, Zephyr valves provided significant and clinically meaningful short-term improvements in either homogeneous or heterogeneous emphysema without CV but with an increase in adverse events.
