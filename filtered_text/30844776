Electrospun fibers offer tremendous potential for tendon and ligament tissue engineering, yet developing porous scaffolds mimicking the size, stiffness and strength of human tissues remains a challenge.
Previous studies have rolled, braided, or stacked electrospun sheets to produce three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds with tailored sizes and mechanical properties.
A common limitation with such approaches is the development of low porosity scaffolds that impede cellular infiltration into the body of the implant, thereby limiting their regenerative potential.
Here, we demonstrate how varying the rotational speed of the collecting mandrel during the electrospinning of  (PCL) can be used to limit inter-fiber fusion (or fiber welding).
Increasing the fraction of unfused fibers reduced the flexural rigidity of the electrospun sheets, which in turn allowed us to bundle the fibers into 3D scaffolds with similar dimensions to the human  (ACL).
These unfused fibers allowed for higher levels of porosity (up to 95%) that facilitated the rapid migration of mesenchymal stem cells  into the body of the scaffolds.
Mechanical testing demonstrated that the fiber-bundles possessed a Young's modulus approaching that of the native human ACL.
The scaffolds were also capable of supporting the differentiation of MSCs towards either the fibrocartilage or ligament/tendon lineage.
This novel electrospinning strategy could be used to produce mechanically functional, yet porous, scaffolds for a wide range of biomedical applications.
