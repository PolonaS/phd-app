Challenges in the diagnostic process of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can result in diagnostic misclassifications, including overdiagnosis.
The term "overdiagnosis" in general has been associated with variable definitions.
In connection with efforts to reduce low-value care, "overdiagnosis" has been defined as a true positive diagnosis of a condition that is not associated with any harm in the diagnosed person.
It is, however, unclear how the term "overdiagnosis" is used in the COPD literature.
We conducted a rapid review of the literature to explore how the terms "overdiagnosis" and "misdiagnosis" are used in the context of COPD.
Electronic searches of Medline were conducted from inception to October 2018, to identify primary studies that reported on over- and/or misdiagnosis of COPD using these terms.
28 articles were included in this review.
Overdiagnosis and misdiagnosis in COPD were found to be used to describe five main concepts: 1) physician COPD diagnosis despite normal spirometry (14 studies); 2) discordant results for COPD diagnosis based on different spirometry-based definitions for airflow obstruction (10 studies); 3) COPD diagnosis based on pre-bronchodilator spirometry results (three studies); 4) comorbidities (
In the COPD literature, the terms "overdiagnosis" and "misdiagnosis" are often used interchangeably and almost always refer to a false positive diagnosis.Use of spirometry with correct interpretation of the results can avoid a substantial proportion of cases of misdiagnosis of COPD.
