The Citrate Lyase (ACL) is the main cytosolic enzyme that converts the citrate exported from mitochondria by the SLC25A1 carrier in  (acetyl-CoA) and oxaloacetate.
Acetyl-CoA is a high-energy intermediate common to a large number of metabolic processes including protein acetylation reactions.
This renders ACL a key regulator of histone acetylation levels and gene expression in diverse organisms including humans.
We have found that depletion of ATPCL, the Drosophila ortholog of human ACL, reduced levels of Acetyl CoA but, unlike its human counterpart, does not affect global histone acetylation and gene expression.
Nevertheless, reduced ATPCL levels caused evident, although moderate, mitotic chromosome breakage suggesting that this enzyme plays a partial role in chromosome stability.
These defects did not increase upon X-ray irradiation, indicating that they are not dependent on an impairment of DNA repair.
Interestingly, depletion of ATPCL drastically increased the frequency of  (CBs) associated to mutations in
