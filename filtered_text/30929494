The purpose of this multicentre observational study was to investigate the association between intraoperative component positioning and soft-tissue balancing on short-term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing robotic-arm assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty .
Between 2013 and 2016, 363 patients (395 knees) underwent robotic-arm assisted UKAs at two centres.
Pre- and postoperatively, patients were administered Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Score (KOOS) and Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12).
Results were stratified as "good" and "bad" if KOOS/FJS-12 were more than or equal to 80.
Intraoperative, post-implantation robotic data relative to CT-based components placement were collected and classified.
Postoperative complications were recorded.
Following exclusions and losses to follow-up, 334 medial robotic-arm assisted UKAs were assessed at a mean follow-up of 30.0 months (8.0 to 54.9).
None of the measured parameters were associated with overall KOOS outcome.
Correlations were described between specific KOOS subscales and intraoperative, post-implantation robotic data, and between FJS-12 and femoral component sagittal alignment.
Three UKAs were revised, resulting in 99.0% survival at two years (95% confidence interval (CI) 97.9 to 100.0).
Although little correlation was found between intraoperative robotic data and overall clinical outcome, surgeons should consider information regarding 3D component placement and soft-tissue balancing to improve patient satisfaction.
Reproducible and precise placement of components has been confirmed as essential for satisfactory clinical outcome.
