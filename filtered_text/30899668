Combined anterior cruciate ligament  and  (MCL) injuries are the most common type of combined ligamentous injury of the knee.
The optimal treatment for these combined injuries is controversial.
Combined ACL and MCL- (POL) reconstruction avoids late anteromedial rotatory instability and chronic valgus instability of the knee and decreases the increased stress on the ACL graft.
Graft choice (hamstring tendon autograft, quadriceps bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft, or Achilles tendon allograft) and anatomic restoration of the medial and posteromedial corner of the knee are challenges of this combined reconstruction.
This article describes a technique that allows combined ACL and MCL-POL reconstruction.
The hamstring tendons from the contralateral limb are tripled and used as the ACL graft.
The gracilis tendon from the ipsilateral limb is doubled and used as the MCL-POL graft.
The semitendinosus tendon of the ipsilateral limb is preserved.
After ACL reconstruction, the MCL-POL graft is suspended on the ACL graft at the distal end of the tibial tunnel and the graft limbs are used for open reconstruction of the MCL and POL.
Three interference screws (Arthrex, Naples, FL) and 1 metal staple are used for graft fixation of this combined reconstruction.
