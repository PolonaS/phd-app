Diagnosis codes might be used for diabetes surveillance if they accurately distinguish diabetes type.
We assessed the validity of
Diabetes case identification and abstraction of diabetes type was done as part of the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study.
The gold standard for diabetes type is the physician-assigned diabetes type documented in patients' medical records.
Using all healthcare encounters with ICD-10-CM codes for diabetes, we summarized codes within each encounter and determined diabetes type using percent of encounters classified as T2DM.
We chose 50% as the threshold from a receiver operating characteristic curve because this threshold yielded the largest Youden's index.
Persons with â‰¥50% T2DM-coded encounters were classified as having T2DM.
Otherwise, persons were classified as having T1DM.
We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy overall and by demographic characteristics.
According to the gold standard, 1911 persons had T1DM and 652 persons had T2DM (mean age (SD): 19.1 (6.5) years).
We obtained 90.6% (95% CI 88.4% to 92.9%) sensitivity, 96.3% (95% CI 95.4% to 97.1%) specificity, 89.3% (95% CI 86.9% to 91.6%) positive predictive value, 96.8% (95% CI 96.0% to 97.6%) negative predictive value, and 94.8% (95% CI 94.0% to 95.7%) accuracy for discriminating T2DM from T1DM.
ICD-10-CM codes can accurately classify diabetes type for persons with youth-onset diabetes, showing promise for rapid, cost-efficient diabetes surveillance.
