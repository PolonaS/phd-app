Acute exacerbations of COPD is characterized by a change in the patients baseline dyspnoea, cough and/or sputum that is beyond normal day to day differences and guides to a change in standard medications in a patient with COPD.
Vitamin D influences the innate & adaptive immune system, and exerts pleiotropic antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory responses.
Vitamin D deficiency is frequent among COPD patients but its contributory role in disease exacerbations is widely debated.
This study was aimed to assess relationship between reduced serum vitamin D (25-OHD) level with COPD severity and acute exacerbation.
This observational cross-sectional study was carried out in the department of Respiratory Medicine, NIDCH, Mohakhali, Dhaka, Bangladesh from October 2016 to September 2017.
Consecutive 80 hospital admitted patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosed on the basis of clinical history & pulmonary function tests and 78 age & sex matched controls were investigated for serum vitamin D (25-OHD) level.
Among the COPD patients, 37% had Vitamin D deficiency (<20ng/ml) and 28.75% had Vitamin D insufficiency (20-29ng/ml).
Mean vitamin D (25-OHD) level of COPD patients (25.82±10.62ngm/ml) was found to be significantly lower than healthy controls (32.57±11.32ngm/ml).
Vitamin D deficiency was found, by Pearson correlation test, to be significantly associated with severity of COPD.
Multivariate analysis showed that age (in years), FEV1 (percent predicted), frequent exacerbators (≥2 in the last year), and smoking (>40 pack year) were significantly associated with Vitamin D deficiency.
Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients was found to have vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with severity of COPD.
Vitamin D deficiency was also associated with frequent disease exacerbation.
