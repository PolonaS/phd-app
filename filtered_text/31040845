Antiphospholipid Syndrome  is an autoimmune disorder, characterized by pregnancy morbidity and/or a hyper coagulable state involving the venous or the arterial vasculature and associated with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), including anti-cardiolipin antibodies (aCL), anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-ÃŸ2GPI), and Lupus anticoagulant .
In recent years there have been many advances in the understanding of the molecular basis of vascular involvement in APS.
APS is of multifactorial origin and develops in genetically predisposed individuals.
The susceptibility is determined by major histocompatibility complex .
Different HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles have been reported in association with APS.
Moreover, MHC II alleles may determine the autoantibody profile and, as such, the clinical phenotype of this disease.
Besides, polymorphisms in genes related to the vascular system are considered relevant factors predisposing to clinical manifestations.
Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) induce genomic and epigenetic alterations that support a pro- thrombotic state.
Thus, a specific gene profile has been identified in monocytes from APS patients -related to aPL titres
