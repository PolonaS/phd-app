The 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games involved 2925 elite athletes, and providing proper health care services for these elite athletes was a critical priority.
We established an emergency department  in the Pyeongchang Mountain Polyclinic during the Olympics, which served staff and athletes from many countries.
This experience, as well as a description of illnesses and injuries encountered during the games, may provide useful information for planning medical care at similar events in the future.
The polyclinic ED operated from January 25 to February 27, 2018.
All cases were enrolled in this study, and their data were analyzed by date and category.
In addition, the number of injuries by body part, number of illnesses by organ system, and illness symptoms and causes were analyzed.
In total, 288 patients were encountered in the ED.
These included 113 injuries and 175 illnesses.
We consulted with 153 staff members and 75 athletes, and reported that the fingers were the most commonly injured body part, followed by the knee.
The respiratory system was the most commonly involved organ system, and the most common cause of illness was infection.
Thirty-eight influenza tests were performed, among which the results of seven were positive.
We performed 17 norovirus tests, among which the results of four were positive.
Our analysis of our ED experience will aid arrangements for medical services in future Winter Games.
Additionally, given our new experience, we will now be able to provide better medical services for future winter sports events.
