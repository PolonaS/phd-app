 (KOA) is associated with muscle weakness, but it is unclear which structures are involved in the muscle changes.
This study assessed morphological alterations and the expression of genes and proteins linked to muscular atrophy and neuromuscular junctions  in KOA, induced by  (ACLT) in rats.
Two groups of rats were assessed: control (without intervention) and KOA (ACLT surgery in the right knee).
After 8 weeks, quadriceps, tibialis anterior  and gastrocnemius muscles were analyzed (area of muscle fibers, NMJ, gene and protein expression).
KOA group showed atrophy in quadriceps (15.7%) and TA (33%), with an increase in atrogin-1 and muscle RING-finger protein-1 .
KOA group showed quadriceps NMJ remodeling (reduction area and perimeter) and decrease in NMJ diameter in TA muscle.
The expression of  (nAChR) γ-nAChR increased and that of α-nAChR and muscle specific tyrosine kinase  declined in the quadriceps, with a decrease in ε-nAChR in TA.
MuRF-1 protein expression increased in quadriceps and TA, with no changes in  (NCAM).
In conclusion, ACLT-induced KOA promotes NMJ remodeling and atrophy in quadriceps and TA muscles, associated with inflammatory signs and changes in muscle gene and protein expression.
