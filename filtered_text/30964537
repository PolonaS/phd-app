A systematic review was performed to compare patellar tendon-bone (BTB) and hamstring tendon  autografts following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in young females, young patients, or females.
One study compared BTB and HS in young females and found a lower rate of graft failure with BTB (P<.02).
Of the 11 studies that made this comparison in females, 1 reported decreased laxity in females with BTB (P=.035).
Of 4 studies comparing autografts in young patients, 1 reported a decreased rate of graft failure with BTB (P=.036).
Further studies making this comparison specifically in young females are warranted.
