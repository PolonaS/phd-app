The primary aim of this study was to determine the effect of NMT on female basketball players (performing at least 3 exercise sessions per week for at least 90 min) with inter limb asymmetry.
Controlled laboratory study.
University research laboratory.
40 female basketball players (age 22.4 ± 1.7 years, height 168.4 ± 5.31 cm, weight 66.6 ± 6.6 kg) who demonstrated neuromuscular deficits on the tuck jump test were allocated to a control group (n = 20), and the NMT group (n = 20).
Experimental group participate in an 8-week NMT program including 6 weeks (18 sessions), each session almost lasted for 30 min.
The peak torque as well as time to peak torques of hip abductors and external rotators as well as knee flexors and extensors muscles, and the performance were measured before and at the end of a 6-week NMT using the isokinetic dynamometer and the hop test battery respectively.
A significant improvement was observed in the NMT group for the peak torque and time to peak torque in hip and knee muscles both concentric and eccentric states at 60 and 180ºsec.
Also, they showed a significant improvement in the distance of single leg hop and single leg triple crossover hop tests.
However, no significant 20 and 21. change was seen in the control group.
An NMT program can significantly improve muscle strength, hop tests scores, and the inter limb asymmetry in female basketball players.
The NMT may be used in ACL prevention in female basketball players with lower limb asymmetry.
