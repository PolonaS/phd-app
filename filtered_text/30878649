The objective of this study was to assess gait variability after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), as an indicative of possible altered gait pattern and a measure of recovery compared to control subjects.
Forty subjects (32 male), divided into 4 groups of 10 participants, were enrolled in the study: a control group (CG), and observational groups OG-I (90 days), OG-II (180 days), and OG-III (360 days) after ACLR.
All subjects underwent the same rehabilitation program for six months.
For kinematic recording, each subject walked on a treadmill for 4 min at a preferred walking speed.
Linear gait variability was assessed using average standard deviation (VAR) and normalized root mean square of medial-lateral (ML) trunk acceleration (RMS
