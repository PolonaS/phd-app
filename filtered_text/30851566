In general, the flexion gap is larger than the extension gap with posterior cruciate ligament-sacrificing total knee arthroplasty.
Several methods compensate for an excessive flexion gap, but their effects are unknown.
The purpose of this study was to compare three methods to compensate for an increased flexion gap.
In this study, squatting in knees with excessive (4 mm) and moderate (2 mm) flexion gaps was simulated in a computer model.
Differences in knee kinematics and kinetics with joint line elevation, setting the femoral component in flexion, and using a larger femoral component as compensatory methods were investigated.
The rotational kinematics during flexion with setting the femoral component in flexion were opposite to those in the other models.
Using a larger femoral component resulted in the most physiological motion.
The peak anterior translation was 10 mm in the joint line elevation model compared with approximately 6 mm in the other models.
In the joint line elevation model, patellofemoral contact stress was excessively increased at 90° of knee flexion.
In contrast, tibiofemoral contact stress was higher during knee extension with setting the femoral component in flexion due to anterior impingement.
There were few differences in the effect of the three compensatory methods with a moderate flexion gap.
A larger femoral component should be used to compensate for an excessive flexion gap because it has less negative impact on posterior cruciate ligament-sacrificing total knee arthroplasty, whereas any compensation method might be acceptable for a moderate flexion gap.
