Maintaining muscle mass and function during rehabilitation from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is complicated by the challenge of accurately prescribing daily energy intakes aligned to energy expenditure.
Accordingly, we present a 38-week case study characterizing whole body and regional rates of muscle atrophy and hypertrophy (as inferred by assessments of fat free mass from DXA) in a professional male soccer player from the English Premier League.
Additionally, in week 6 we also quantified energy intake (via the remote food photographic method) and energy expenditure using the doubly labeled water method.
Mean daily energy intake (CHO: 1.9-3.2, Protein: 1.7-3.3 and Fat: 1.4-2.7 g.kg
