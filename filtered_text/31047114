Clinical trials of COPD pharmacotherapy typically involve aging populations with moderate-to-severe COPD, but the latter is often diagnosed by spirometric criteria that are not age-appropriate across the continuum of lung function.
We have therefore re-evaluated the clinical effect of combination therapy (salmeterol plus fluticasone) in moderate-to-severe COPD, using more age-appropriate spirometric criteria from the  (GLI) and trial data from Towards a Revolution in COPD Health .
Of the 6112 TORCH participants, 5688 (93.1%) had GLI-based moderate-to-severe COPD (mean age 64.8 years).
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality and the primary comparison was combination therapy vs. placebo.
Secondary outcomes included COPD and  (CV) mortality and pneumonia.
A modified intention-to-treat analysis evaluated differences in time-to-event over a three-year period, using Cox proportional hazards models with statistical significance at p < 0.010 (acknowledging repeated significance testing).
Relative to placebo, combination therapy yielded a statistically non-significant reduction in all-cause mortality-adjusted hazard ratio [adjHR] 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64, 0.95), p = 0.012.
Relative to placebo, combination therapy also yielded statistically non-significant reductions in COPD and CV mortality-adjHR 0.75 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.02), p = 0.068 and adjHR 0.76 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.09), p = 0.135, respectively.
In contrast, combination therapy yielded a statistically significant increased risk of pneumonia, relative to placebo-adjHR 1.80 (95% CI: 1.46, 2.21), p < 0.001.
In GLI-based moderate-to-severe COPD, combination therapy yields a statistically significant increased risk of pneumonia but the reductions in mortality are not statistically significant, although could potentially be clinically meaningful.
