Single-leg squats are a common dynamic balance clinical assessment.
However, little is known about the relationship between parameters that influence squat movement and postural control performance.
The objective of this study was to determine the relationships between squat parameters (speed and depth) and postural control under single-task and dual-task.
Thirty healthy college students performed single-leg squats under single-task and dual-task with Stroop.
Random intercepts general linear mixed models determined the effect of squat parameters on center of pressure parameters.
