We developed a  (COPD) patient-reported experience measure (PREM-C9).
174 patients with COPD (86 [49%] with a confirmed diagnosis and 88 [51%] with a self-reported diagnosis of COPD) completed a 38-item list, COPD Assessment Test  and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale .
Hierarchical and Rasch analysis produced a 9-item list (PREM-C9).
It demonstrated fit to the Rasch model (χ² p=0.33) and correlated moderately with CAT (r=0.42), HAD-anxiety  and HAD-depression (r=0.41) (p<0.05).
A substudy confirmed its ability to detect change prepulmonary and postpulmonary rehabilitation.
The PREM-C9 is a simple, valid measure of experience of patients living with COPD, validated in this study population with mild to very severe disease; it may be a useful measure in research and clinical audits.
