To introduce MRI-based  (ISAKOS) classification system of meniscal tears and correlate it to the surgical findings from arthroscopy.
We hypothesized that the ISAKOS classification will provide good inter-modality and inter-rater reliability for use in the routine clinical practice of radiologists and orthopedic surgeons.
In this HIPAA-compliant cross-sectional study, there were 44 meniscus tears in 39 patients (26 males, 16 females).
Consecutive arthroscopy-proven meniscal tears (March 2017 to December 2017) were evaluated by two board-certified musculoskeletal radiologists using isotropic three-dimensional (3D) MRI user-defined reconstructions.
The surgically validated ISAKOS classification of meniscal tears was used to describe medial meniscus  and  (LM) tears.
 (PABAK) and conventional kappa, and paired t test and  (ICC) were calculated for categorical and numerical variables, respectively.
For the MM, the PABAK for location, depth, length (ICC), pattern, quality of meniscus tissue, and zone was 0.7-1, 0.65, 0.57, 0.67, 0.78, and 0.39-0.7, respectively.
For the LM, the PABAK for location, depth, length , pattern, quality of meniscus tissue, zone, and central to popliteus hiatus was 0.57-0.95, 0.57, 0.74, 0.93, 0.38, 0.52-0.67, and 0.48, respectively.
The mean tear lengths were larger on MRI than on arthroscopy (mean difference MM 9.74 mm (6.66 mm, 12.81 mm; p < 0.001), mean difference LM 4.04 mm (0.31 mm, 7.76 mm; p = 0.034)).
The ISAKOS classification of meniscal tears on 3D MRI provides mostly moderate agreement, which was similar to the agreement at arthroscopy.
• There is a fair to good inter-method correlation in most categories of ISAKOS meniscus tear classification.
• The tear lengths are significantly larger on MRI than on arthroscopy.
• The inter-reader correlation on 3D MRI is moderate to excellent, with the exception of  tear patterns.
