Growing evidence exists that match-related fatigue induces biomechanical alterations that might increase lower extremity injury risk.
Fatigue studies often use match simulation protocols that expose all subjects to a standardized demand (e.g.
a fixed distance/time).
In those studies, the induced level of fatigue depends then on subjects' fatigability.
If between-subjects variability in fatigability is high, this might confound overall fatigue effects.
Therefore the first aim was to investigate whether a fatigue protocol with fixed demand causes alterations in landing patterns.
Secondly, we assessed the relationship between fatigability and landing patterns as we hypothesized that athletes with high fatigability would show movement patterns that involve greater injury risk.
Eighteen athletes performed three different unilateral landing tasks before and after a match simulation protocol while muscle activation (vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, hamstrings medialis, hamstrings lateralis, gastrocnemius medialis, gastrocnemius lateralis, gluteus medius) and landing kinematics and kinetics of the hip, knee and ankle joint were recorded.
Furthermore ratings of perceived exertion  were administered to measure fatigability.
ANOVA analyses were conducted to investigate fatigue effects on landing patterns.
Correlation analyses assessed the relationship between fatigability (post-fatigue RPE) and landing patterns.
The ANOVA analyses did not show any overall post-fatigue alterations in landing patterns.
However, correlation analyses showed an association between fatigability and landing patterns.
Athletes who had higher RPE scores showed smaller post-fatigue knee flexion angles and smaller pre- and post-fatigue knee abduction angles across different landing tasks.
The fixed demand protocol did not cause overall alterations in landing patterns.
When fatigability was taken into account, high fatigability was related with less optimal landing patterns.
