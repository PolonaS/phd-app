To investigate the association between choice of treatment and patients' income after  (CL) injury and assess the effect of different covariates such as sex, age, comorbidities and type of work.
This entire-population cohort study in Sweden included working patients with a diagnosed CL injury between 2002 and 2005, identified in The National Swedish Patient Register (n = 13,662).
The exposure was the treatment choice (operative or non-operative treatment).
The main outcome measure was average yearly income five years after CL diagnosis, adjusted for the following covariates: sex, age, comorbidities, type of work, region, calendar year, education and income.
Relative to non-operative treatment, operative treatment was associated with greater average yearly incomes (nine to 15%) after injury among patients between 20 and 50 years, patients with partial university education, patients living in large cities and patients with one comorbidity, despite no overall significant association in the national cohort.
Delayed operative treatment (>1 year) had no significant association with income change, whereas early operative treatment (<1 year) was associated with higher average yearly incomes (11 to 16%) among females, patients between 20 and 50 years, patients living in large cities and patients with one comorbidity.
In a broad sense, treatment choice was not associated with changes in income five years after CL injuries among patients in the workforce, however earlier operative treatment was associated with higher average incomes among patients with ages between 20 and 50, females, living in large cities, with one comorbidity and with a high level of education.
