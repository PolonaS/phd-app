Determine if associations between demographic, appendicular joint osteoarthritis , clinical characteristics reflect different phenotypes of OA in the lumbar spine.
Participants were from the Johnston County OA Project.
Demographics consisted of age, sex, and race (White and African American [AA]) and clinical characteristics consisted of  (BMI), low back pain and injury, and knee, hip and hand  (OA).
Participants were categorized as  (SOA), facet joint OA , both SOA and FOA, or neither SOA nor FOA (referent group).
Multinomial regression models were used to determine odds ratios  and 95% confidence intervals .
The average age (n=1,793) was 66.2 years (SD=10.1) and BMI was 30.7 (SD=6.2).
A majority (63.8%) were women (n=1,144) and 31.8% (n=570) AA.
Neither SOA nor FOA was present in 18.0%; 22.8% had FOA, 13.2% had SOA and 46.0% had both SOA and FOA.
In adjusted analyses, AA were less likely to have FOA (OR=0.68 95% CI 0.49, 0.95) and both SOA and FOA (OR=0.51 95% CI 0.37, 0.70).
Women were more likely to have FOA (OR=1.71 95% CI 1.24, 2.36).

Race, sex, BMI, hip OA, and lower back injury may inform different OA phenotypes in the lumbar spine.
