Vitamin D plays an important role in the musculoskeletal system of the human body.
Here, we review the most current literature on vitamin D as it relates to orthopaedic surgery and the musculoskeletal system, focusing largely on non-fracture applications.
A literature review was performed on the basic science of vitamin D metabolism, epidemiology of vitamin D levels, role of vitamin D within the musculoskeletal system, and the correlation of vitamin D with injuries and orthopaedic surgical outcomes.
The existing literature suggests vitamin D plays multiple roles in the musculoskeletal system.
Recent research has shed light on the importance of vitamin D in the setting of soft tissue healing and recovery in addition to affecting postoperative outcomes after common orthopaedic procedures.
Given the widespread prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, orthopaedic surgeons should be aware of the current evidence regarding clinical implications in patients with musculoskeletal complaints.
