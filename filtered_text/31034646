Excessive dynamic airway collapse  is associated with significant respiratory morbidity.
It has been hypothesized that EDAC may limit the benefits of lung-transplantation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  patients.
We aim to find the effect of bilateral lung transplantation on EDAC in COPD patients.
Retrospective chart review was performed to identify patients with concomitant presence of COPD and EDAC before undergoing bilateral lung-transplantation from Dec 2011 to Dec 2014.
Pre and post-transplant pulmonary function tests,  (FV) loops, computed tomography  of the chest, and flexible bronchoscopies were studied.
165 patients underwent bilateral lung-transplantation during the study period.
8 patients had COPD and EDAC prior to the transplant.
Post transplantation, 7 out of 8 patients showed resolution of EDAC on expiratory CT chest and 1 patient did not have post-transplant CT chest.
All 8 showed no EDAC on post-transplant surveillance bronchoscopy.
Post-transplant, mean predicted FEV1/FVC increased from 37% to 117% and mean predicted FEV1 increased from 20% to 61%.
There is resolution of EDAC post bilateral lung-transplantation in this retrospective COPD patient population.
EDAC should not be considered as a benefit limiting factor to bilateral lung-transplantation.
However, prospective studies are required to explore potential indication.
