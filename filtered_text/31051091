Traditional, center-based pulmonary rehabilitation has documented positive outcomes for patients with COPD, and has accordingly been incorporated into algorithms of care in clinical guidelines.
However, it remains grossly underutilized in its current form.
While lack of knowledge of the process and potential benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation among patients, health care providers and payers is an issue, lack of access to this therapy is a significant problem.
Creating new center-based programs in more assessable and convenient geographic areas would help in this regard, but current under-funding in many health care systems precludes this.
One potential approach is extending the pulmonary rehabilitation intervention into the patient's home or community.
From the limited number of clinical studies that have evaluated pulmonary rehabilitation outside of traditional settings, it appears that home-based interventions (presumably with less resource utilization) may produce equivalent patient-centered outcomes as center-based care.
Whether these results would be realized in clinical settings outside of academic centers (where the studies were performed) is still unknown.
Changing a model of care with proven benefits has its risks.
Chief among these is the potential for diluting the intervention in order to increase availability, thereby making it less effective.
Balancing increasing availability with maintaining quality will require continued development of innovative models supported by rigorous clinical research and robust quality assurance processes.
