The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a flattened bone tunnel has a positive effect on the tendon-bone healing  process in the early period after anterior cruciate ligament  reconstruction.
Seventy-two New Zealand White rabbits were randomly allocated into two groups, the flattened tunnel  group and the conventional round tunnel  group.
We compared the cross-sectional areas and diameters of the bone tunnels between the two groups through  (CT) scanning.
TBH results between the two groups were assessed by histological analysis, micro-CT scanning and biomechanical tests at 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks after operation.
The cross-sectional areas of the bone tunnels between the two groups were almost the same.
However, the shape of bone tunnels in the FT group was more flattened.
A faster cellular and collagen remoulding process were found in the FT group.
Semiquantitative histological analysis of Safranin O staining showed that there was more fibrocartilage formation in the interface region in the FT group (P < 0.05).
Sirius Red staining showed that the tissues in the interface areas were more intense in the FT group.
Micro-CT scanning showed that more new bone formation could be found in the interface region in the FT group.
The biomechanical tests also showed that FT ACL reconstruction will result in a stronger regenerated tendon-bone interface.
Our study found that a flattened bone tunnel accelerated TBH in the early period after ACL reconstruction surgery in a rabbit model, which lays the groundwork for further clinical practice of this ACL reconstruction method.
