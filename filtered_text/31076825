The aim of the current study was (1) to provide an overview of common definitions and classification systems of  (RL) and (2) to systematically review the available literature with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of RLs in  (ACL)-deficient knees.
Following the PRISMA guidelines, MEDLINE and Scopus were searched for articles (1) reporting on acute or chronic ACL injuries, (2) with concomitant medial meniscus injury, (3) located at the posterior meniscocapsular attachment site (and red-red zone).
Ex vivo studies, reviews and technical notes were excluded.
Twenty-seven studies were included based on the criteria mentioned above.
RLs are common in ACL-deficient knees with a prevalence ranging from 9 to 24%.
RLs should especially be suspected in younger patients, patients with an increased meniscal slope and in patients with prolonged time from injury to surgery.
The sensitivity of MRI for the detection of RLs ranges from 48 to 86% at a specificity of 79-99%.
For arthroscopy, RLs are easily missed through standard anterior portals (sensitivity 0-38%).
RL repair leads to a significant improvement of subjective knee scores, regardless of the specific fixation technique.
For stable RLs, the literature suggests equivalent postoperative stability for trephination and abrasion compared to surgical RL repair.
Ramp lesions are frequently missed in ACL-deficient knees on standard arthroscopy with anterior portals only.
If a RL is suspected, exploration via an additional posteromedial portal is indicated.
In case of instability, RL repair should be performed.
