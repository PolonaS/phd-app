 (COPD) is a progressive lung disease with approximately 174 million cases worldwide.
Electronic questionnaires are increasingly used for collecting patient-reported-outcome  data about disease symptoms.
Our aim was to leverage PRO data, collected to record COPD disease symptoms, in a general modelling framework to enable interpretation of PRO observations in relation to disease progression and potential to predict exacerbations.
The data were collected daily over a year, in a prospective, observational study.
The e-questionnaire, the  (EXACT®) included 14 items (i.e.
questions) with 4 or 5 ordered categorical response options.
An item response theory  model was used to relate the responses from each item to the underlying latent variable (which we refer to as disease severity), and on each item level,  (MM) with 4 or 5 categories were applied to describe the dependence between consecutive observations.
Minimal continuous time MMs were used and parameterised using ordinary differential equations.
One hundred twenty-seven COPD patients were included (median age 67 years, 54% male, 39% current smokers), providing approximately 40,000 observations per EXACT® item.
The final model suggested that, with time, patients more often reported the same scores as the previous day, i.e.
the scores were more stable.
The modelled COPD disease severity change over time varied markedly between subjects, but was small in the typical individual.
This is the first IRT model with Markovian properties; our analysis proved them necessary for predicting symptom-defined exacerbations.
