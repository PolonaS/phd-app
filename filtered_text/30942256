 (ACL) is regarded as a public health problem in the Oiapoque basin, between Brazil and French Guiana.
Data on ACL occurrence/epidemiological profile and etiology were sourced from Brazilian health services and a reference laboratory.
Rainfall correlation was also analyzed.
Majority of the ACL cases were observed in adult men working as gold miners.
ACL incidence peaks appeared to be linked to periods 2 months after the dry season.
Migratory flow was found to be a non-negligible complicating factor in epidemiological surveillance.
Binational strategies are required to minimize exposure for high-risk populations.
