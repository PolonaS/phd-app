Tibia plateau fractures are severe knee injuries which have a great impact on the patients' lives, but in what extend is not clear yet in the literature.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the short-term gait alternations after severe tibia plateau fractures treated with circular Ilizarov frame.
Gait pattern evaluation was performed to patients who were treated with circular Ilizarov frame after severe tibia plateau fractures (Schatzker IV-VI), three to six months after the frame removal.
Gait evaluation performed by using a force plate in a walking platform at self selected speeds.
Data collected from two walking tasks for each limb.
Demographic, clinical, radiological and quality of life questionnaire (SF-12v2) and COST data were also collected.
The gait pattern of sixteen patients (aged 48.8 ± 13.3 years), following treatment with circular Ilizarov frame for severe tibia plateau fractures (Schatzker IV-VI) was analysed.
The tests were performed at an average of 10.4 months after the initial treatment.
SF-12v2 Mental scores have returned to normal (mean 55.8 ± 11.9) but physical scores remained impaired (mean 40.6 ± 11.3).
COST scores reached average levels (mean 54.1 ± 19.8).
A one-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to compare the GRFs and gait timing data of the affected limb with the normal one.
Single limb support interval was significantly reduced to the affected limb (p < 0.001) and terminal stance phase was prolonged for the normal limb (p = 0.05).
The rest of the GRF and gait timing data did not reach significant differences.
During the early stages of rehabilitation following severe tibia plateau fractures treated with circular Ilizarov frame, the gait pattern returns to normal curve morphology, but with reduced single limb support and terminal stance phases at the affected knee.
Mental status returns to normal but symptoms and function remain impaired.
