The objective of the research is studying of demographic and clinical profile as well as treatment effectiveness of patients with AH and COPD based on National Register of Arterial Hypertension.
Among the analyzed selection, consisted of 32 571 patients with AH, who were followed up in the primary medical care, at the average age of 64Â±7 years old (there were 64% women of them), 5.4% patients with AH had COPD.
The analysis of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases frequency as well as treatment effectiveness was made.
According to National Register of Arterial Hypertension, cardiovascular [coronary heart disease, Q myocardial infarction,  (CHF), peripheral artery atherosclerosis] and cerebrovascular (stroke/transitory ischemic attack) diseases are accurately more often diagnosed at patients with AH and COPD.
Male sex and age are the strongest independent factor, contributing into the risk of development of cardiovascular diseases at these patients.
COPD considerably increases the risk of CHF development.
The conducted analysis has shown that treatment, prescribed to patients with AH and COPD meets modern recommendations.
