Increasing evidence suggests the role of non-criteria aPLs as important supplements to the current criteria aPLs in APS.
In this study, we evaluated the clinical performance of a panel of non-criteria antibodies to phospholipid  (aPS), phosphatidylinositol (aPI), sphingomyelin (aSM), phosphatidylcholine (aPC)  (aPE) in a well-defined Chinese APS cohort.
A total of 229 subjects were tested, including 86 patients with APS, 104  (DCs) and 39  (HCs).
Serum IgG/IgM aCL, IgG/IgM aβ2GP1, IgG/IgM aPS, IgG/IgM aPI, IgG/IgM aSM, IgG/IgM aPC, and IgG/IgM aPE were tested by ELISA.
The presence of aPE, aPS, aPI, aPC, and aSM in patients with APS and Disease Controls were 8.1% (7/86) and 1.0% (1/104), 37.2% (32/86) and 9.6% (10/104), 50.0% (43/86) and 8.7% (9/104), 23.3% (20/86) and 1.0% (1/104), and 18.6% (16/86) and 1.9% (2/104), respectively.
In criteria aPLs, aCL IgG demonstrated the highest positive likelihood ratio  of 35.75, followed by LA (LR+ of 13.51) and aCL IgM (LR+ of 11.64).
In non-criteria aPLs, aPC IgG demonstrated the highest LR+ of 24.94 followed by aSM IgM (LR+ of 14.97).
Importantly, the non-criteria aPLs were detected in 18.8% (3/16) of seronegative APS patients.
The criteria aPLs, including LA, IgG aCL and IgG aβ2GPI, were significantly correlated with both arterial thrombosis and venous thrombosis, while the non-criteria aPLs, including IgG aPS, IgM aPS, IgG aPI and IgG aPC were significantly associated with arterial thrombosis but not venous thrombosis.
In summary, our findings indicate that those non-criteria aPLs may be particularly helpful for patients in whom APS is highly suspected, but conventional aPLs are repeatedly negative as well as for predicting APS patients with arterial thrombosis.
