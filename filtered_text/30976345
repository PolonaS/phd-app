The posterior cruciate ligament is one of the important tissues and structures sustaining the knee joint, and its rupture or detachment may lead to joint instability or destruction.
The present study aimed at investigating the Open Reduction and Internal Fixation surgery of posterior cruciate ligament and comparing it to the normal knee of the same side.
In this study, 25 patients with avulsion fracture at the PCL joint were treated with open surgery and screw fixation.
The patients were followed up by Lysholm knee score for at least 12 months after surgery.
All patients were male with an average age of 25 years over the years 2010-2018.
The common mechanism of injury in these patients was motorcycle-car accident.
In the study with Lysholm knee score, 21 patients (80%) obtained the good score of 60-90 while 20% of patients were placed in the fair group (30-59).
The average score was 86.
The obtained score of knee function questionnaire in this study had no significant difference from other similar studies, and most patients achieved a good and acceptable score after the surgery.
There was no knee instability and functional impairment in the patients compared to the normal knee.
Considering the clinical results after the fixation of the PCL avulsion fracture causing a significant improvement in patients, the surgery could be considered as an acceptable and effective method for treating such impairment and fracture.
