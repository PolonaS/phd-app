It has been suggested that adults who use cleaning agents in their homes have a higher risk of asthma and allergic symptoms.
The associations of asthma and allergic symptoms with household use of cleaning agents in adolescents have not been investigated yet.
To examine the associations of household cleaning agents use with the prevalence of asthma, rhinitis and eczema in adolescents.
In this cross-sectional analysis, we included participants of the PIAMA birth cohort study with data on household use of 10 types of cleaning agents and information on asthma, rhinitis and/or eczema from parent-completed questionnaires at age 14 (N = 2333).
For the cleaning agents, we developed a composite score ranging from 0 (no exposure) to 30 points (household use on 4-7 days per week for all 10 types of cleaning agents).
Logistic regression was used to analyse associations between household cleaning agents use (composite score and specific cleaning agents) and outcomes, adjusting for potential confounders.
Seven, 13 and 11% of the participants had asthma, rhinitis and eczema, respectively, at age 14.
The composite score for household use of cleaning agents was not associated with asthma, rhinitis and eczema.
For instance, adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for the prevalence of asthma, rhinitis and eczema comparing those with the highest use of cleaning agents (≥10 points) to those with never/seldom use (0-4 points) were 0.95 (0.56, 1.63), 1.23 (0.82, 1.82) and 0.95 (0.56, 1.63), respectively.
For individual cleaning agents, we only found the use of ammonia to be significantly associated with a lower risk of rhinitis [0.60, (0.44, 0.82)].
There was no indication of an increased prevalence of asthma, rhinitis or eczema among adolescents living in households within the highest category of cleaning agents use.
