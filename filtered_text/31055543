Introduction: Atherosclerosis is one of the most common co-morbidities observed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
A better understanding of mechanisms of atherosclerosis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is needed to improve clinical outcomes.
The aim: to evaluate the plasma levels of lipid parameters, atherogenic indices, systemic inflammatory markers and to assess their relationship with the severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Materials and methods: A total of 72 subjects diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 41 healthy controls, the same gender and age categories, with â‰¥ 10 pack years smoking history, were followed-up of about 5.8 years.
Blood tests with determination of lipid profiles, atherogenic indices and systemic inflammatory markers were conducted in remaining patients who fulfilled inclusion criteria of the study.
Results: Triglyceride, atherogenic index of plasma, cardiogenic risk ratio and atherogenic coefficient values were significantly higher, but high-density lipoprotein cholesterol- significantly lower in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than in controls.
Lipid profiles were similar in lower-risk (stage A and B) and higher-risk (stage C and D) patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The analysis showed that atherogenic indices and serum high sensitive C-reactive protein were inversely correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 sec, especially in higher-risk patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (r = - 0.61 p < 0.05; r = - 0.57 p < 0.05; r = - 0.54 p < 0.05 and r = - 0.49 p < 0.05 respectively).
Conclusions: Atherogenic indices and serum high sensitive C-reactive protein can be considered as useful biochemical markers to predict an early stage of atherosclerosis especially in higher-risk patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
