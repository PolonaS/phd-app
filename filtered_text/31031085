To describe the etiologic distribution of all injuries among U.S. Army Active Duty soldiers by causal energy categories.
Retrospective cohort, descriptive analysis.
Injury was defined as the interruption of tissue function caused by an external energy transfer (mechanical, thermal, radiant, nuclear, chemical, or electrical energy).
A comprehensive injury matrix standardized categories by causal energies, body locations, and injury types.
Categories differentiated acute  from cumulative micro-traumatic  overuse injuries, and musculoskeletal injuries  from those affecting other or multiple body systems (non-MSKI).
International Classification of Diseases  diagnoses codes were organized into established categories.
The matrix was applied to electronic health records for U.S. Army soldiers in 2017.
Mechanical energy transfers caused most injuries (97%, n = 809,914): 76% were CMT overuse and the remaining were ACT (<21%).
The majority (83%) were MSKI (71% CMT, 12% ACT).
While almost one-half (47%) were to lower extremities (38% CMT, 9% ACT) the most frequently injured anatomical sites were the knee and lower back (16% each, primarily CMT).
For the first time all soldiers' injuries have been presented in the same context for consistent comparisons.
Findings confirm the vast majority of injuries in this physically-active population are MSKI, and most are CMT MSKI.
A very small portion are non-MSKI or injuries caused by non-mechanical energy (e.g., heat- or cold-weather).
Most Army injuries are to the lower extremities as a grouped body region, but additional matrix specificity indicates the most injured anatomical locations are the knee, lower back, and shoulder.
