<sec id="st1"> <title>SETTINGS</title>  (HGS) is widely used to evaluate nutrition and adverse outcomes in several diseases.
However, the relationship between HGS and the parameters of  (COPD) are not known.
</sec> <sec id="st2"> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> To evaluate HGS in male patients with stable COPD, and to assess its correlation with dyspnoea and functional exercise capacity.
</sec> <sec id="st3"> <title>DESIGN</title> We recruited 116 male out-patients with stable COPD from a general hospital in China between February and December 2017.
For each patient, we recorded demographic characteristics and measured pulmonary function, dyspnoea, exercise capacity, body composition and HGS.
</sec> <sec id="st4"> <title>RESULTS</title> HGS had a significantly positive correlation with muscle mass, lung function, and  (6MWD) and a negative correlation with the modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea score.
Multiple linear regression analysis showed that combining age, fat-free mass , 6MWD and duration of COPD accounted for 43.1% of the total variance in HGS.
</sec> <sec id="st5"> <title>CONCLUSION</title> HGS was correlated with dyspnoea and exercise capacity.
Aging and disease could alter upper limb muscle strength in COPD patients.
Hence, HGS might be a simple method for assessing muscle function and for identifying patients with a noticeable reduction in HGS, who will need early, multidisciplinary intervention.
