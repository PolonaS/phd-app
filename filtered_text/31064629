<sec id="st1"> <title>BACKGROUND</title> People living with the human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) may be particularly vulnerable to the consequences of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) given their defective T cell-mediated immunity and high rates of structural lung disease.
</sec> <sec id="st2"> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> To determine the prevalence of NTM in PLWH hospitalized with pneumonia and to assess the potential predictors of NTM isolation.
</sec> <sec id="st3"> <title>METHODS</title> Secondary data analysis of a prospective cohort study (2007-2011) of early bronchoscopy in PLWH presenting with suspected pneumonia was undertaken.
Subjects with any species of NTM, henceforth described as 'NTM of undetermined significance' (NTM-US), isolated from sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), were included in the analysis.
Potential predictors were chosen a priori.
</sec> <sec id="st4"> <title>RESULTS</title> Among 196 HIV-infected subjects hospitalized with pneumonia, 96 had respiratory samples positive for NTM-US, with 91% of all NTM-US isolated from sputum compared with BALF.
The overall prevalence of NTM-US was 49% (96/196).
More NTM subjects were smokers (
