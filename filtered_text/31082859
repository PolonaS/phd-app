Multi-morbidity and frailty are consequences of aging with HIV, yet not everyone with medical disease is frail.
Our objective was to identify factors associated with frailty in a multi-morbid HIV-infected cohort.
Analysis of a prospective, observational, longitudinal cohort.
Three hundred thirty two participants in the medically advanced NNTC were categorized as frail, pre-frail, or robust with the Fried Frailty Index.
A series of logistic regression analyses (first univariate, then multivariable) were conducted to determine whether medical comorbidities, immunologic and virologic parameters, and/or neuropsychiatric variables predicted increased odds of frailty.
The mean number of medical comorbidities per participant was 2.7, mean CD4 T-cell count was 530â€Šcells/mm3, and 77% had undetectable HIV RNA in blood.
Twenty two percent were frail, 55% pre-frail, and 23% robust.
Significant predictors of frailty in multivariable analysis were: cognitive diagnosis rendered by Frascati criteria, depressive symptoms,  (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and sex.
Men were less likely to be frail than women.
Higher odds of frailty were seen with: symptomatic, but not asymptomatic, cognitive impairment (compared to cognitive normals); more depressive symptoms; DM; and COPD.
Neuropsychiatric illness increased odds of being frail on a predominantly physical/motoric measure, but only when symptomatic.
Lack of association with asymptomatic impairment may reflect the importance of functional limitation to frailty, or possibly a unique resilience phenotype.
Understanding why sex and symptomatic neuropsychiatric illness are associated with frailty will be important in managing HIV-associated morbidity in aging populations.
