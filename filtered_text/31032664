The BODE group designed a bubble chart, analogous to the solar system, which depicts the prevalence of each disease and its association with mortality and called it a "comorbidome".
Although this graph was used to represent mortality and, later, the risk of needing hospital admission, it was not applied to visualize the association between a set of comorbidities and the categories of the GOLD 2017 guidelines, neither according to the degree of dyspnea nor to the risk of exacerbation.
For the purpose of knowing to which extent each comorbidity associates with each of the two conditions-most symptomatic group (groups B and D) and highest risk of exacerbation (groups C and D)-we performed a analysis based on the comorbidome.
439 patients were included.
Cardiovascular comorbidity (especially cardiac and renal disease) is predominantly observed in patients with a higher degree of dyspnea, whereas bronchial asthma and stroke occur more frequently in subjects at higher risk of exacerbation.
This is the first time that the comorbidome is presented based on the categories of the GOLD 2017 document, which we hope will serve as a stimulus for scientific debate.
