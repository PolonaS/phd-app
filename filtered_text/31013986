Patients with  (COPD) often suffer from multiple morbidities, which occur in clusters and are sometimes related to accelerated aging.
This study aimed to assess the disease specificity of comorbidity clusters in COPD and their association with a biomarker of accelerated aging as a potential mechanistic factor.
Body composition, metabolic, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and psychological morbidities were objectively evaluated in 208 COPD patients (age 62 ± 7 years, 58% males, FEV
(co)morbidities were more prevalent in COPD patients compared to controls (3.9 ± 1.7 vs. 2.4 ± 1.5,
Two COPD-specific comorbidity clusters, a "Cachectic" and "Psychologic" cluster, were identified and warrant further studies regarding their development.
Accelerated aging was present across various multimorbidity clusters in COPD.
