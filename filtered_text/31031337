Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  is one of the most common respiratory diseases.
Assessment of medication nonadherence and quality of life  is important in such chronic diseases.
The aim of the study was to describe treatment nonadherence and QOL of COPD patients and their associated factors.
A cross-sectional study was performed in Mansoura Chest Hospital on 133 already diagnosed inpatient cases of COPD from March to August 2017.
Data were collected using two validated questionnaires, Morisky Medication Adherence Scale to assess medication adherence and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD patients  to assess QOL.
About 45% of studied group were nonadherent to prescribed medications.
Logistic regression analysis showed that duration of disease is the only independent risk factor for nonadherence.
The scores on SGRQ-c indicated sever QOL affection in COPD.
SGRQ-c scores show significant impairment with the presence of comorbidities, hospital admission, and frequency of exacerbations.
Nonadherence to treatment was affected mainly by the duration of disease.
QOL impairment in COPD is influenced by broad range of factors suggesting the importance of QOL assessment in those patients.
No association was found between nonadherence to treatment and QOL.
