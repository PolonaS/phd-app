We compared autografts and allograft using partial and complete transphyseal  (ACL) reconstruction techniques among skeletally immature individuals.
Male and females younger than 18 and 16 years old, respectively, diagnosed with ACL tear from April 2006 to March 2012 entered the study.
One group had four-strand hamstring autograft, and the other had tibialis posterior allograft reconstruction.
Those who had allografts either had hyper-laxity or recurvatum.
Achieved mean (± SD) 2000 International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score was not statistically different (P = 0.385) between allograft (n = 13) (84.3 ± 3.2) and autograft groups (n = 18) (85.6 ± 4.4).
Mean  (KOOS) subscale Knee-Related Quality of Life at 2 years was 78.0 ± 7.2 and 75 ± 7.4 for allograft and autograft groups, respectively (p = 0.261).
Mean 2-year KOOS subscale Sports and Recreation was 82.1 ± 5.8 and 84.8 ± 6.6 for allograft and autograft groups, respectively (p = 0.244).
No patient reported instability, giving way, or locking of the knee.
Pivot shift test was negative in all patients; however, a minor positive Lachman test was found in six cases (46%) within the allograft group and seven cases (39%) in the autograft group.
One postoperative septic arthritis was documented in the autograft group.
Considering existing concern that joint laxity and recurvatum are among the precursors of non-contact ACL injury in adolescents, bone-patellar-bone autografts are not applicable in this age group because of the open physis; furthermore, considering that hamstring autografts are insufficient (size thickness and stretchability), we recommend soft tissue allografts for ACL reconstruction in skeletally immature patients.
