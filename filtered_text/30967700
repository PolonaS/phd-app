The debate continues regarding the best way to reconstruct posterior cruciate ligament .
The objective of this study was to compare the knee stability and clinical outcomes after single and double bundle (SB and DB) PCL reconstruction.
A total of 98 patients with PCL injury were enrolled for PCL reconstruction with four-strand semitendinosus and gracilis tendon autograft in the SB technique (
The SB and DB groups showed comparable demographic data.
After a minimum followup interval of 24 months, the data of 59 patients in the SB group and 30 patients in the DB group were analyzed.
There was no statistical difference between the SB and DB group in terms of both knee stability and clinical outcomes (
Compared with the SB technique, the DB technique did not exhibit any superiority in knee stability or clinical outcomes.
