While cross-sectional studies have shown associations between certain occupational exposures and lower levels of lung function, there was little evidence from population-based studies with repeated lung function measurements.
We aimed to investigate the associations between occupational exposures and longitudinal lung function decline in the population-based Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study.
Lung function decline between ages 45 years and 50 years was assessed using data from 767 participants.
Using lifetime work history calendars completed at age 45 years, exposures were assigned according to the ALOHA plus Job Exposure Matrix.
Occupational exposures were defined as ever exposed and cumulative exposure -unit- years.
We investigated effect modification by sex, smoking and asthma status.
Compared with those without exposure, ever exposures to aromatic solvents and metals were associated with a greater decline in FEV
Exposures to aromatic solvents and metals were associated with greater lung function decline.
The effect of aromatic solvents was strongest in women.
Preventive strategies should be implemented to reduce these exposures in the workplace.
