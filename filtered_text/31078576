Minimal clinically important difference  has become the most important psychometric property for interpreting change individual's responses over time from the patient's perspective, evaluating study results and planning sample sizes.
The purpose was to synthesize and critically appraise MCID of the most frequently used hip, knee and foot and ankle specific  (PROs).
A search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science from each site's respective inception through January 2019 for MCID in 25 PROs.
The studies reporting their results with anchor-based method were included.
228 full-text articles were assessed for the eligibility and 48 were included in the final evaluation.
Our synthesis provides a comprehensive assessment of MCID for 16 disease-specific PROs.
MCID of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index (37.5%), International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form and Knee Injury (14.5%) and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (14.5%) were found mostly presented PROs.
Studies mainly (85%) used ROC analysis to elicit MCID.
MCID is increasingly used as a measure of patient's improvement.
However, MCID varied based on the analytic methods, study population, type of disease, the baseline status, change in values and treatments and patient demographics.
Therefore, it should be interpreted with caution.
