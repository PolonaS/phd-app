Agriculture exposures are associated with reducing the risk of allergy and asthma in early life; yet, repeated exposures later in life are associated with chronic bronchitis and obstructive pulmonary diseases.
The objective of this study was to investigate the airway inflammatory response to  (ODE) in mice with established  (OVA)-induced experimental asthma.
C57BL/6 mice were either OVA sensitized/aerosol-exposed or  (Sal) sensitized/aerosol-challenged.
Both groups were then subsequently challenged once with intranasal  or swine confinement ODE to obtain 4 treatment groups of Sal-Sal, Sal-ODE, OVA-Sal, and OVA-ODE.
 (AHR) to methacholine, bronchiolar lavage fluid, lung tissues, and serum were collected.
Intranasal inhalation of ODE in OVA-treated (asthmatic) mice (OVA-ODE) increased AHR and total cellular influx marked by elevated neutrophil and eosinophil counts.
Flow cytometry analysis further demonstrated that populations of CD11c
