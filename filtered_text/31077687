 (ACO) has frequent exacerbations, and a poor quality of life and prognosis compared to COPD alone.
However, the pathogenesis of ACO has not been fully elucidated yet.
The aim of this study was to investigate nitrosative stress, which causes a redox imbalance and tissue inflammation in the airways of patients with ACO, and to evaluate the relationship between nitrosative stress and the clinical course in the study subjects.
Thirty healthy subjects and 56 asthmatic patients participated in this study.
The asthmatic patients were divided into 33 asthmatic patients and 23 ACO patients.
The study subjects had been followed prospectively for 2 years to evaluate the clinical course.
Nitrosative stress was evaluated by the production of  (3-NT) in sputum cells.
The production of 3-NT was significantly enhanced in the ACO patients compared to the asthmatic patients.
The amounts of reactive persulfides and polysulfides, newly identified powerful antioxidants, were significantly decreased in the ACO group.
The baseline levels of 3-NT were significantly correlated with the frequency of exacerbations and decline of FEV
These findings suggested that greater nitrosative stress occurred in the airways of patients with ACO and the degree of nitrosative stress was correlated with an impairment of the clinical course.
Nitrosative stress might be related to the pathogenesis of ACO.
