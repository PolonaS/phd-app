Exacerbations in  (COPD) have a considerable impact on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life.
Procalcitonin  a polypeptide normally produced in neuroendocrine cells of the thyroid and lungs is a marker of systemic inflammation and bacterial infection.
The aim of this study was to determine the levels of PCT in serum of  (AECOPD) and stable COPD patients in North Indian population.
The study was conducted on 80 AECOPD and 80 stable COPD patients in respiratory medicine department at tertiary care hospital in north India.
PCT levels were measured in serum by ELISA kit.
GraphPad Prism version 6.01 (GraphPad software Inc.; La, Jolla, CA, USA) was used for analysis of data.
The present study showed that mean serum PCT levels were significantly higher in AECOPD group (1.31 ± 0.79) as compared to stable COPD group (0.1 ± 0.09) (P < 0.001).
The study confirms that PCT levels were higher in AECOPD patients as compared to stable COPD patients.
PCT could be used as a biomarker of exacerbations of COPD and can be used to target management and guiding the treatment in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD.
