Focal defects in articular cartilage are unable to self-repair and, if left untreated, are a leading risk factor for osteoarthritis.
This study examined cartilage degeneration surrounding a defect and then assessed whether infilling the defect prevents degeneration.
We created a focal chondral defect in porcine osteochondral explants and cultured them ex vivo with and without dynamic compressive loading to decouple the role of loading.
When compared to a defect in a porcine knee four weeks post-injury, this model captured loss in  (sGAGs) along the defect's edge that was observed in vivo, but this loss was not load dependent.
Loading, however, reduced the indentation modulus of the surrounding cartilage.
After infilling with in situ polymerized hydrogels that were soft (100 kPa) or stiff (1 MPa) and which produced swelling pressures of 13 and 310 kPa, respectively, sGAG loss was reduced.
This reduction correlated with increased hydrogel stiffness and swelling pressure, but was not affected by loading.
This ex vivo model recapitulates sGAG loss surrounding a defect and, when infilled with a mechanically supportive hydrogel, degeneration is minimized.
