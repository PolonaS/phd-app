Landing kinetic outcomes are associated with injury risk and may be persistently altered after ACL injury or reconstruction.
However, it is challenging to assess kinetics clinically.
The relationship between sound characteristics and kinetics during a limited number of functional tasks has been supported as a potential clinical alternative.
The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between kinetics and sound characteristics during a single leg landing task.
Observational.
Laboratory.
Twenty-six healthy participants (15 males/11 females, age = 24.8±3.6 years, height = 176.0±9.1 cm, mass = 74.9±14.4 kg, Tegner = 6.1±1.1).
Participants completed single leg landings onto a force plate while audio characteristics were recorded.
Peak vGRF, linear loading rate, instantaneous loading rate, peak sound magnitude, sound frequency.
Means and standard deviations were calculated for each participant's individual limbs.
Spearman's
Peak sound magnitude was positively correlated with normalized peak vGRF(
Peak sound magnitude may be more helpful in providing feedback about an individual's normalized vGRF and linear loading rate and sound frequency may be more helpful in providing feedback about instantaneous loading rate.
Further refinement in sound measurement techniques may be required before these findings can be applied in a clinical population.
