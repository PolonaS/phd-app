Reseptor tyrosine kinases (cMET and EGFR) are important in lung cancer targeted therapy.
We believe if we can use them as markers for clinicians to help decide the diagnosis of lung cancer.
This parameter will be important in serum samples of patients with lung cancer diagnosis and treatment.
The aim of this study is aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of serum protein and circulating mRNA of cMET and HGF in lung cancer patients.
We also analyzed the correlation of mRNA expression with clinicopathologic parameters.
We performed  (ELISA) to measure and compare serum protein and circulating mRNA of cMET and HGF levels in peripheral blood from 60 lung cancer patients and 40 healthy control group.
We found that both protein and gene expression levels of serum c-MET, HGF and EGFR were significantly higher in patients with lung cancer than control group.
There was no association between HGF, cMET, EGF, EGFR (both protein and gene) expression levels with age, gender, smoking habit, COPD, pathological types or tumor size, stage, metastatic-non metastatic adenocarcinoma-squamous carcinoma, SCLC-NSCLC.
As a result of ROC analysis, serum cMET (AUC: 0.892) and HGF protein (AUC: 0.784) were diagnosed in lung cancer patients (Fig.
1).
The AUC values of serum EGF and EGFR proteins were calculated to be 0.631 and 0.692, respectively.
To our knowledge this is the first study comparing the levels of protein and mRNA in the serum material of HGF, c-MET, EGF and EGFR parameters in lung cancer patients' blood samples.
Further prospective studies with more participants for better understanding of mechanism and effect for HGF and c-MET inhibitors in lung cancer will help us to identify of these biomarkers role for guiding us to sellect individualized itargeted therapies.
