Knee pain has a variety of etiologies in the pediatric population, including septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, fracture, ligamentous injury, and neoplasms.
Extrinsic sources of knee pain may also be intra-abdominal, although abdominal pathology is much more likely to manifest as hip or proximal thigh musculature pain.
A 5-year-old healthy male presented with atraumatic right knee pain, discomfort with weightbearing, fever, and elevated inflammatory laboratory markers.
Physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging findings of the knee were benign, leading to low clinical suspicion for knee septic arthritis.
Blood cultures were positive for a gastrointestinal organism, Granulicatella adiacens, suggesting abdominal pathology leading to referred pain.
Ultrasound evaluation and  (CT) of the abdomen revealed a large abscess secondary to perforated appendicitis, which was treated with CT-guided drainage and i.v.
antibiotics.
The patient's musculoskeletal pain subsided with treatment of the appendicitis.
WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?
: Acute appendicitis may present as knee pain, with other signs and symptoms mimicking septic arthritis, such as fever, inability to bear weight, and elevated inflammatory markers.
Considering an array of differential diagnoses in pediatric patients with apparent knee septic arthritis is crucial to prevent delay in diagnosis of alternative infectious sources.
