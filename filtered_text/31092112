The FIFA 11+ has shown to increase muscle strength and reduce injury risk.
The purpose of this study was to assess the short and long-term effects of the FIFA 11+ on knee strength, and muscle latency after sudden inversion of amateur futsal players.
Seventy-one male futsal players were recruited and randomized to a FIFA 11+ (n = 37, age: 27.0 ± 5.1 years) and a control group (n = 34, age: 26.0 ± 5.1 years).
The FIFA 11+ programme was executed twice a week, for 10 weeks, followed-up after 10 weeks where both groups executed regular warm-ups.
Concentric and eccentric isokinetic knee muscle strength was tested and latency time of the evertor muscles after sudden inversion of the ankle was executed with a trapdoor mechanism following an EMG protocol of selected leg muscles (peroneus brevis and peroneus longus).
No significant difference were observed between groups for short-term changes in isokinetic strength after adjustment for baseline differences.
At long-term, significant gains were obtained after adjustment for baseline differences in eccentric strength for both lower limbs as for the H/Q ratios for the dominant limb.
No changes between groups were observed in the peroneus brevis and peroneus longus latency time.
Performing FIFA 11+ did not have short-term effects on knee strength and muscle latency after sudden inversion in amateur futsal players.
However, significant long-term benefits were observed for eccentric strength and H/Q ratios.
Highlights The FIFA 11+ induced significant long-term benefits in eccentric strength in amateur futsal players.
The FIFA 11+ also improved long-term benefits in H/Q conventional and functional ratios of the knee of amateur futsal players The enhancements observed with the application of the FIFA 11+ in amateur futsal players may bring benefits in injury reduction.
