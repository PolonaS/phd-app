The aim of this study was to assess the differential laxity after reconstruction of the  (ACL) by the TLS
We carried out a prospective monocentric study on patients undergoing unilateral  repair between December 2014 and June 2016.
All patients were followed up for at least 12 months.
The series compares 61 patients operated on using the TLS
There was no significant difference in the patients' epidemiological characteristics and pre-operative scores between the two groups.
Average pre-operative differential laxity was 6.5 mm ± 2.1 (min 3; max 12) in the TLS group and 6.4 mm ± 2.0 (min 0; max 11) in the hamstring group, with no statistically significant difference.
The average post-operative difference in laxity was - 0.1 mm ± 1.9 (min - 5; max 4) in the TLS group and 0.3 mm ± 2.0 (min - 7; max 5) in the hamstring group.
Again, no significant difference was observed between groups.
This study demonstrates a level of post-operative differential laxity control using TLS comparable with that of the ACL reconstruction technique using a hamstring graft with preserved tibial insertion.
