Clinical practicum is a major component in nursing education.
Students are able to apply their classroom learning to the actual care setting.
The clinical practicum setting must provide an authentic environment where students can maximize learning opportunities and demonstrate knowledge, skills, and attitude in caring for patients.
Herein lies the challenge.
The real world setting and timing may not be enough for students to learn the many complex tasks demanded as course outcomes and expected competencies.
The purpose of this study was to describe the usefulness of using multimedia case study courseware in facilitating learning among students.
The Virtual Clinical Environment multimedia courseware was structured around five case studies featuring major health concerns among adults, namely : chronic heart failure, stroke, breast cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and dementia.
Students were asked to use case studies in developing nursing care plans which facilitated authentic learning and encouraged active and reflective learning.
Students were also encouraged to critically think and effectively solve problems.
The case studies in the courseware helped in demonstrating the scope and processes of the clinical practicum, illustrating the setting, and stimulating critical thinking and decision-making in doing patient assessment and care.
