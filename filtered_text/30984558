Knee joint kinematics and kinetics during running recover at 12 months, not 6 months, following  (ACL) reconstruction surgery.
Knee muscle strength is a criterion used to assess an individual's readiness to  (RTS); however, the relationship between knee muscle strength and knee biomechanics is unclear.
This study investigated the relationship between knee muscle strength and dynamic knee biomechanics during running at 6 and 12 months after ACL reconstruction surgery.
Knee joint kinematics and kinetics during running were analyzed in 21 patients (10 males, 11 females) who underwent ACL reconstruction for a unilateral ACL deficiency.
Kinematics and Kinetics were measured by three-dimensional motion analysis system, and Knee flexion angle was calculated using Point cluster technique and internal extension moment was calculated by the inverse dynamics method.
Patients were compared to a control group matched by age, height and weight.
Isokinetic knee extension and flexion strength in ACL-reconstructed patients were measured at 6 and 12 months postsurgery, by separated gender.
Knee flexion angle was significantly lower in ACL patients at 6 months postsurgery compared to the control group (F (2, 62)=5.78,
Dynamic knee biomechanics during running were not restored 6 and 12 months after ACL reconstruction both male and female.
It is necessary to strengthen knee extension and flexion muscles to restore knee kinetics during running, especially female patients.
