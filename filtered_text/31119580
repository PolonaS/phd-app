Chronic nonmalignant pulmonary diseases impose a heavy burden on patients, generate health-care costs, and contribute to poor health-related quality of life.
It has been found that a wide range of factors negatively affects quality of life, but the role of acceptance of illness needs to be further investigated.
The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between acceptance of illness and quality of life in patients with chronic nonmalignant pulmonary diseases.
The study encompassed 200 patients of the mean age 58 ± 16 years who were mainly diagnosed with asthma (n = 72; 36%), COPD (n = 52; 26%), and obstructive sleep apnea (n = 38; 19%).
The patients answered the  (AIS) and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire .
Sociodemographical and clinical data were collected.
The level of acceptance of illness significantly associated with each of the SGRQ domains.
The greater the acceptance of illness, the lowest was the SGRQ score.
The mean total score of SGRQ was 44.6 ± 24.9 and that of AIS was 26.1 ± 8.2.
Higher AIS scores significantly associated with lower SGRQ scores, i.e., with better quality of life (p < 0.001 for each domain).
We conclude that in patients with chronic nonmalignant pulmonary diseases, acceptance of illness plays an important role and is closely related to the general level of quality of life.
Interventions aimed at improving acceptance of illness may be considered to improve quality of life.
