Solid fuels are widely used in China.
Household air pollution from the burning of solid fuels may increase the risk of  (COPD), but prospective evidence is limited.
We examined the association of solid fuel use for cooking and heating with the risk of COPD in a prospective cohort study.
Participants were from the China Kadoorie Biobank.
Current and previous fuels used for household cooking and heating were self-reported at baseline in 2004-2008.
In the present study, "solid fuels" refers to coal and wood, whereas "cleaner fuels" refers to energy sources that presumably produce lower levels of indoor pollution, including electricity, gas, and central heating.
A total of 475,827 adults 30-79 y of age without prevalent COPD were followed through the end of 2015.
We used adjusted Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios for COPD.
Over 9.1 y of follow-up, 9,835 incident COPD cases were reported.
Compared with the use of cleaner fuels for cooking, using coal and wood for cooking was positively associated with COPD, with fully adjusted HRs of 1.06 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.15) and 1.14 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.23), respectively.
Adjusted HRs for heating with coal and wood were 1.16 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.29) and 1.21 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.35), respectively.
The positive association between cooking with solid fuel and COPD appeared to be limited to women and never- (vs. ever-) smokers.
COPD risk increased with a higher number of years of solid fuel use for heating and wood use for cooking.
The use of solid fuel for cooking and heating was associated with the increased risk of COPD in this prospective cohort study.
Studies with more accurate exposure assessment are needed to confirm the association.
