Supervised exercise training  as part of pulmonary rehabilitation is arguably the most effective intervention for improving exercise tolerance in patients with  (COPD).
In the current review, we focus on the physiological rationale for EXT and the expected physiological benefits that can be achieved in patients who can be exposed to sufficiently high training stimuli.
Thus, after a brief consideration of the mechanisms of exercise limitation and their sensory consequences, we expose the potential beneficial effects of EXT on respiratory mechanical and peripheral muscular adaptations to exercise.
The available evidence indicates that changes in exertional ventilation, breathing pattern, operating lung volumes and static respiratory muscle strength after EXT are modest and often inconsistent.
Inspiratory muscle training may have a role in patients showing inspiratory weakness pre-rehabilitation.
Beneficial changes in peripheral muscles can be seen in those who can tolerate higher training intensity, particularly using combined resistance and dynamic (including interval) exercise.
It should be recognised, however, that it might not be feasible to reach meaningful physiological training effects in many frail elderly patients with advanced respiratory mechanical and pulmonary gas exchange derangements with serious co-morbidities (such as cardiac and peripheral vascular disease).
These potential shortcomings should not discourage the use of pulmonary rehabilitation as an effective strategy to improve patients' capacity to tolerate physical activity.
Currently, the greatest challenge is to develop effective strategies to ensure that these important gains in functional capacity are translated into sustained increases in daily physical activity for patients with COPD.
