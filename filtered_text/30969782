The Patient Reported Outcomes Information System  is an efficient metric able to detect changes in global health.
To assess the responsiveness, convergent validity, and  (CID) of PROMIS compared with disease-specific scales after knee arthroscopy.
Cohort study (Diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2.
A prospective institutional review board-approved study collected PROMIS  (PF), PROMIS Pain Interference ,  (IKDC), and  (KOOS) results in patients undergoing knee arthroscopy.
The change from preoperative to longest follow-up was used in analyses performed to determine responsiveness, convergent validity, and minimal and moderate CID using the IKDC scale as the anchor.
Of the 100 patients enrolled, 76 were included.
Values of the effect size index  ranged from near 0 to 1.69 across time points and were comparable across scales.
Correlations of the change in KOOS and PROMIS with IKDC ranged from r values of 0.61 to 0.79.
The minimal CID for KOOS varied from 12.5 to 17.5.
PROMIS PF and PI minimal CID were 3.3 and -3.2.
KOOS moderate CID varied from 14.3 to 18.8.
PROMIS PF and PI moderate CID were 5.0 and -5.8.
The PROMIS PF and PI showed similar responsiveness and CID compared with disease-specific scales in patients after knee arthroscopy.
PROMIS PI, PROMIS PF, and KOOS correlations with IKDC demonstrate that these scales are measuring a similar construct.
The ESIs of PROMIS PF and PI were similar to those of KOOS and IKDC, suggesting similar responsiveness at 6 months or longer (ESI >1.0).
Minimum and moderate CID values calculated for PROMIS PF and PI using IKDC as an anchor were sufficiently low to suggest clinical usefulness.
PROMIS PF and PI can be accurately used to determine improvement or lack thereof with clinically important changes after knee arthroscopy.
