The purpose was to quantify the effects of mid-flight whole-body and trunk rotation on knee mechanics in a double-leg landing.
Eighteen male and 20 female participants completed a jump-landing-jump task in five conditions: no rotation, testing leg ipsilateral or contralateral (WBRC) to the whole-body rotation direction, and testing leg ipsilateral (TRI) or contralateral to the trunk rotation direction.
The WBRC and TRI conditions demonstrated decreased knee flexion and increased knee abduction angles at initial contact (2.6 > Cohen's dz > 0.3) and increased peak vertical ground reaction forces and knee adduction moments during the 100 ms after landing (1.7 > Cohen's dz > 0.3).
The TRI condition also showed the greatest knee internal rotation angles at initial contact and peak knee abduction and internal rotation angles and peak knee extension moments during the 100 ms after landing (2.0 > Cohen's dz > 0.5).
Whole-body rotation increased contralateral knee loading because of its primary role in decelerating medial-lateral velocities.
Trunk rotation resulted in the greatest knee loading for the ipsilateral knee due to weight shifting and mechanical coupling between the trunk and lower extremities.
These findings may help understand altered trunk motion in anterior cruciate ligament injuries.
