An early detection of Osteoarthritis is urgently needed and still not possible until today.
The aim of the study was to assess whether molecular biomarkers of cartilage turnover are associated with longitudinal change in knee cartilage thickness during a 2 year period in individuals with increased risk of developing knee osteoarthritis.
A secondary aim was to assess whether prior knee injury or subjective patient-reported outcomes at  (BL) were associated with articular cartilage changes.
Nineteen volleyball players (mean age 46.5 ± 4.9 years, 47% male) with a 30-year history of regular high impact training were recruited.
The serum biomarkers Cpropeptide of type II procollagen , cartilage oligomeric matrix protein , collagenase generated carboxy-terminal neoepitope of type II collagen (sC2C), cartilage intermediate layer protein 2 , and the urine biomarkers C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II) and collagenase-generated peptide(s) of type II collagen (C2C-HUSA) were assessed at BL and at 2 year  (FU).
Femorotibial cartilage thinning, thickening and absolute thickness change between BL and FU was evaluated from magnetic resonance imaging.
Subjective clinical status at BL was evaluated by the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form and the Short-Form 36 Physical Component Score.
CILP-2 was significantly higher at FU and linearly associated with the absolute cartilage thickness change during the experimental period.
Prior injury was a predictor of increased absolute cartilage thickness change.
Measuring the change in the cartilage biomarker CILP-2 might be a valid and sensitive method to detect early development of knee osteoarthritis as CILP-2 appears to be related to cartilage thickness loss in certain individuals with increased risk of developing knee osteoarthritis.
Prior knee injury may be predictive of increased articular cartilage thickness change.
