New biologic strategies are arising to enhance healing and improve the clinical outcome of  (ACL) reconstruction.
To evaluate the efficacy of a new oral nutritional supplement (Progen) that contains hydrolyzed collagen peptides and plasma proteins, a hyaluronic acid-chondroitin sulfate complex, and vitamin C.
Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.
The study included patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with hamstring autografts using the same fixation method.
All patients received the same analgesia and  (PT) protocol and were randomized to receive either the nutritional supplement (supplemented group) or no additional therapy (control group).
Patients were followed up at days 7, 30, 60, and 90.
Pain was assessed by use of a  (VAS) and by analgesic consumption.
Clinical outcome was assessed via International Knee Documentation Committee  score and the number of PT sessions.
Perceived efficacy and tolerability were rated on a 5-point Likert scale.
Graft maturation was assessed by a blinded musculoskeletal radiologist using magnetic resonance imaging.
The number of  (AEs) was recorded.
The intention-to-treat analysis included 72 patients, 36 allocated to the supplemented group and 36 to the control group, with no significant differences regarding demographic and preoperative characteristics.
Both groups showed significant improvement in pain and function (measured by VAS and IKDC scores) during the 90-day follow-up period (
The combination of the nutritional supplement and PT after ACL reconstruction improved pain, clinical outcome, and graft maturation.
Nutritional supplementation showed higher efficacy during the second month of recovery, without causing AEs.
