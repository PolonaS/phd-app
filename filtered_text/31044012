Flat-footed individuals are believed to have poorer jump performance compared to normal-arched individuals.
Foot orthoses are commonly used to support the deformed foot arch, and improve normal foot function.
However, it is unclear if foot orthoses use affects jump performance in athletes.
Our study aims to investigate if foot type and/or foot orthosis influence countermovement jump  and  (SBJ) performance and lower limb biomechanics.
Twenty-six male basketball players were classified into normal-arched (
For CMJ, the flat-footed group exhibited less ankle plantarflexion (
Foot type and the use of foot orthoses influence take-off biomechanics, but not actual CMJ and SBJ performances in basketball players.
Compared to the normal-arched individuals, flat-footed athletes generated smaller propulsion GRF and lower hip flexion velocity and power, which suggests possible compensatory movement strategies to maximise jump performance.
Future studies may investigate whether these altered biomechanics, taking into consideration their respective magnitude and effect sizes, may have implications on lower limb injuries.
The use of foot orthoses resulted in biomechanical changes in both the normal-arched and flat-footed groups but does not enhance jumping performance.
