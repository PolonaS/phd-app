 (PA) is the most important opportunistic pathogen in causing nosocomial infections and, furthermore, poses a permanent threat for severe chronic infections in patients with cystic fibrosis or COPD.
The transmembrane protein CD26 with dipeptidyl peptidase-4  activity shows an increased expression in inflamed tissue.
We tested whether CD26/DPP4 deficiency leads to reduced inflammation and decreased structural damage when infected with PA.
CD26/DPP4
Compared to saline treated controls, in both infected groups (1) the acinar airspace was significantly increased, (2) the volume density of the alveolar epithelium was significantly decreased, (3) the septal thickness was significantly reduced, (4) more than 40% of the alveolar epithelial surface was damaged, and up to 36% of the epithelial surface was covered with edema.
In infected CD26
CD26/DPP4 deficiency resulted in reduced pulmonary edema under sublethal PA infection, implicating a role for CD26 in infection progression.
The partly pronounced structural damage may mask further possible influences of CD26 on the inflammatory response.
