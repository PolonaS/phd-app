This review summarizes current understanding of mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction applicable to mechanisms of lung diseases and outlines challenges and future directions in this rapidly emerging field.
Although the role of mitochondria extends beyond the term of cellular "powerhouse", energy generation remains the most fundamental function of these organelles.
It is not counterintuitive to propose that intact energy supply is important for favorable cellular fate following pulmonary insult.
In this review, the discussion of mitochondrial dysfunction focuses on those molecular mechanisms that alter cellular bioenergetics in the lungs: (a) inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain, (b) mitochondrial leak and uncoupling, (c) alteration of mitochondrial Ca
