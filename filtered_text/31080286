This study was conducted to evaluate functional outcome in patients undergoing/underwent arthroscopic surgery for degenerative knees with mechanical symptoms or acute exacerbation of symptoms, not amenable to conservative measures.
This was a longitudinal type of study (prospective and retrospective).
For the prospective cohort, followup was done at an interval of 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year to record visual analog scale , International Knee Documentation Committee , and  (SF-8) scores.
For the retrospective cohort, hospital records were studied to record the preoperative VAS score.
Preoperative IKDC and SF-8 scores were recorded at final followup based on recall method (patient's memory).
Furthermore, postoperative VAS, IKDC, and SF-8 scores at final followup were recorded.
There were a total of 46 knees (28 retrospective and 18 prospective) in 44 patients.
The mean age was 52.34 Â± 11.73 years.
There were 28 female knees and 18 male knees.
The mean followup of patients in the retrospective cohort was 55 months (range: 13-126 months), whereas all patients in prospective cohort completed the minimum followup of 1 year.
The improvements in VAS, IKDC, and SF-8 were statistically significant.
Forty-one cases were successful and five cases were failure.
All successful patients (41 cases) said "yes" and all failure cases (05) said "no" to the question-"If given a choice, would you still like to get the same surgery done for the same problem??".
There was one complication deep venous thrombosis.
We recommend arthroscopic surgery in patients with degenerative knees, with mechanical symptoms and acute exacerbation of symptoms, not amenable to conservative measures.
