Conventional anatomical single bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction technique with round tunnels could not simulate morphology of native insertion, while studies about ACL reconstruction technique with modified tunnels based on morphology of anatomical insertion are rare.
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate an ACL reconstruction technique with rounded rectangle tibial tunnel and oval femoral tunnel and compare clinical outcomes with conventional technique.
A prospective comparative study was performed in 80 consecutive subjects who underwent ACL reconstruction with the conventional round tunnels (RT-Group, n=40) or modified tunnels (MT-Group, n=40).
For the modified surgery, the tunnel was modified with a bone file based on the anatomical direction and area of the remnant insertion fibers.
Graft maturity were evaluated by MR images at 12 months postoperatively and patients were examined for functional scores, physical examinations at 2-year follow-up.
The primary variable was the pivot-shift test.
No serious complications were experienced in either group.
Seventy patients (87.5%) were examined at 2-year follow-up, significant improvements were seen in both groups compared with the preoperative values in terms of all clinical assessments.
Tegner scores, pivot-shift test results and SNQ value in the MT-Group were significantly better than RT-Group (
