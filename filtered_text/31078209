We examine recent findings that have revealed interdependence of function within the chemoreceptor pathway regulating breathing and sympathetic vasomotor activity and the hypersensitization of these reflexes in chronic disease states.
Recommendations are made as to how these states of hyperreflexia in chemoreceptors and muscle afferents might be modified in treating sleep apnea, drug-resistant hypertension, chronic heart failure-induced sympathoexcitation, and the exertional dyspnea of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
