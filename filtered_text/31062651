What can we learn from embryogenesis to increase our understanding of how regeneration of damaged adult lung tissue could be induced in serious lung diseases such as  (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  and asthma?
The local tissue niche determines events in both embryogenesis and repair of the adult lung.
Important constituents of the niche are extracellular matrix  molecules including proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans (GAG).
GAGs, strategically located in the pericellular and extracellular space, bind developmentally active growth factors and morphogenes such as  (FGF), transforming growth factor-ÔÅ¢  and bone morphogenetic proteins  aside from cytokines.
These interactions affect activities in many cells, including stem cells, important in development and tissue regeneration.
Moreover, it is becoming clear that the "inherent code", such as sulfation of disaccharides of GAGs is a strong determinant of cellular outcome.
Sulfation pattern, deacetylations and epimerizations of GAG chains function as tuning forks in gradient formation of morphogens,  and cytokines.
Learning to tune these fine instruments, i.e.
interactions between  (GF), chemokines and cytokines with the specific disaccharide code of GAGs in the adult lung, could become the key to unlock inherent regenerative forces to override pathological remodeling.
This review aims to give an overview of the role GAGs play during development and similar events in regenerative efforts in the adult lung.
