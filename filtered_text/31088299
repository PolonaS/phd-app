Airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling is an important pathological feature in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Tobacco smoke  induces the production of large amounts of  (ROS) in COPD lungs.
We investigated how ROS lead to airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling in COPD.
We used in vitro bronchial and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (BSMCs and PASMCs), in vivo TS-induced COPD rodent models and lung tissues of COPD patients.
We found that H2O2 and  (TSE) induced calpain activation in BSMCs and PASMCs.
Calpain activation was elevated in smooth muscle of bronchi and pulmonary arterioles in COPD patients and TS-induced COPD rodent models.
Calpain inhibition attenuated H2O2- and TSE-induced collagen synthesis and proliferation in BSMCs and PASMCs.
Exposure to TS causes increases in airway resistance, right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and thickening of bronchi and pulmonary arteries.
Calpain inhibition by smooth muscle-specific knockout of calpain and the calpain inhibitor MDL28170 attenuated increases in airway resistance, RVSP and thickening of bronchi and pulmonary arteries.
Moreover, smooth muscle-specific knockout of calpain did not reduce TS-induced emphysema in the mouse model, but MDL28170 did reduce TS-induced emphysema in the rat model.
This study provides the first evidence that ROS-induced calpain activation contributes to airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling in TS-induced COPD.
Calpain might be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of COPD.
These results indicate that ROS-induced calpain activation contributes to airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension in COPD.
