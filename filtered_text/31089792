 (AC) joint dislocations are common in a young and active population, especially in people performing contact sports.
Full recovery with a fast and high rate of return to sport is desirable.
This systematic review aims to combine patient outcomes in order to help surgeons in addressing patient expectations regarding the return to sport after surgical intervention for AC dislocations.
To conduct this systematic review, the PRISMA guidelines were followed.
Articles were included if written in English or Dutch and evaluated return to sport after any type of surgical intervention for  types III to VI AC dislocations in patients practicing sports.
Outcome parameters were return to sport, time to return to sport, level of sport, functional outcome scores and complications.
Twelve studies involving 498 patients were included, of which 462 patients practiced sports.
432 (94%) patients returned to sport.
The weighted mean time to return to sport was 4.0Â months.
338 out of 401 patients (84%) returned to the same level of pre-injury sport and 35 patients (9%) lowered their level of sport.
The weighted mean Constant score was 92 out of 100.
The rate of return to sport after surgical intervention for  (RW) III-VI AC dislocations is high.
However, the level of evidence was low and due to the methodological heterogeneity between studies, subgroup analyses of return to sport outcomes were not feasible.
Systematic review of level I-IV studies, level IV.
