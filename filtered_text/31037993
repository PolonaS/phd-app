We aimed to compare right and left ventricular functions by  (ECHO) according to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  groups, and to determine their associations with functional parameters.
Data of patients with COPD who underwent ECHO between 2015 and 2018 were analyzed retrospectively.
The results of pulmonary function tests,  (6MWT),  (mMRC), COPD assessment test , and BODE scores were recorded together with ECHO results showing right and left ventricular functions.
126 COPD patients were evaluated.
Of these, 37.3% was in group A, 28.6% in group B, 12.7% in group C, and 21.4% in group D. Most common comorbidities were cardiovascular diseases  and pulmonary hypertension ; these were most frequently seen in groups D and B.
Regarding ECHO parameters, differences were present among groups in systolic pulmonary arterial pressure  and left ventricle end-systolic diameter (LVEF) (p < 0.001 and 0.004, respectively).
sPAP was highest in groups D and B whereas LVEF was lowest in group D.
Our results suggest that patients' symptoms in symptomatic COPD groups B and D might be related to increased PAP and concomitant cardiovascular comorbidities.
Therefore, a detailed cardiovascular investigation should be performed from early stages in COPD.
