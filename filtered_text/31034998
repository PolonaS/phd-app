The concordance between asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap  defined according to GINA/GOLD and other diagnostic criteria is unknown.
To assess the concordance between different ACO definitions and to estimate the definition-based ACO prevalence and characteristics.
A prospective, real life study based on a 32-item dataset was performed in a mixed population of asthma and COPD patients.
Five different definitions of ACO, including the GINA/GOLD criteria were analyzed.
1609 patients were included in the final analysis.
Application of Venn diagram for ACO populations resulted in 31 ACO subpopulations, which were further reduced to 6 separate populations by introducing a rank order for the analyzed definitions to classify patients from intersecting groups.
Overall, the level of agreement between different ACO definitions was poor.
Cohen's kappa coefficient for the agreement between ACO GINA/GOLD definition with other ACO definitions varied from 0.06 to 0.21.
Only 2 patients (0.12%) met all the ACO definitions.
Definition-based ACO prevalence ranged between 3.8% (Spanish criteria) and 18.4% (clinician's diagnosis).
573 (33.4%) patients met the criteria from at least one ACO definition.
Patients who could not be classified as "pure" asthma, "pure" COPD or ACO accounted for as much as 27.5% of the whole investigated group.
The most severe symptoms were observed in ACO patients defined as COPD and asthma diagnosed < 40 yrs of age.
The current ACO definitions identify distinct populations which share only a small number of common features and present with different disease phenotypes.
ACO prevalence is highly variable, depending on the definition applied.
