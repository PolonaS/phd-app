Thoracic organ transplantation made a fresh start in Hungary with the first double lung transplant in December 2015.
This major leap in Hungarian transplantation was preceded by almost 10 years of preparation, new infrastructure development, and structural changes not only at the organizational level but in human resources as well.
In the following years, until recently, altogether 47 lung transplants were performed on 24 men and 23 women.
The underlying pathologies were as follows: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 25; cystic fibrosis, 11; idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 7; as well as other diseases, including bronchiectasis, eosinophilic granuloma, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and primary pulmonary hypertension in 4 cases.
The youngest recipient was 13 and the oldest was 65 years old.
Overall survival rates at 30 days and at 1 year were 96% and 82%, respectively.
No patients were lost in the cystic fibrosis and other diseases group, whereas the 1-year survival rates of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis groups were 73% and 71%, respectively.
The results show the robustness and viability of the program, although there is still opportunity for further improvement.
In this short paper, we summarize the fields of possible further cooperation of thoracic and cardiac teams as well as future challenges facing the new Hungarian lung transplant program.
