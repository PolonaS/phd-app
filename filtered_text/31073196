An association between sleep duration and a wide spectrum of diseases has been reported, but little is known about its relationship with chronic rhinosinusitis .
The present study aimed to investigate whether sleep duration was associated with CRS after adjusting for potential confounding factors in Korean adults.
We analyzed data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2009 and enrolled 24,658 participants aged ≥20 years.
Data regarding sociodemographic characteristics, self-reported sleep duration, CRS, and other medical diseases were collected from questionnaires.
Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify the relationship between sleep duration and CRS.
The overall prevalence of CRS was 4.4%.
Subjects with sleep duration ≤5 hours showed a highest prevalence for CRS (6.1%), compared to subjects with longer sleep duration (p = 0.02).
After adjusting for covariates (age, sex, household income, residency, dwelling type, education, depression, alcohol, allergic rhinitis, chronic otitis media, angina or myocardial infarction, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, and gastric ulcer), the sleep duration of ≤5 hours was significantly associated with CRS (OR = 1.502; 95% CI = 1.164-1.938).
Only in older subgroup (≥50 years old), shorter sleep duration (≤5 hours) showed higher odds for CRS.
These results suggested that sleep duration may be negatively associated with CRS in older Korean adults.
