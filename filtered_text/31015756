Numerous surgical techniques and fixation methods have been described in  (MPFL) reconstruction such as choice of graft, graft fixation method of patella/femur and initial tension.
We describe short term clinical results of MPFL reconstruction by using soft suture anchor and adjustable cortical fixation system.
Twenty-four patients who underwent isolated MPFL reconstruction by using soft suture anchor and adjustable cortical fixation system were included in this study.
All patients were followed up for at least 2 years, and pre-operative and 2 years post-operative Kujala score, IKDC score and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score were used to assess clinical outcome.
Radiographic evaluation included the Q angle, congruence angle and patellar tilt angle.
Pre- and post-operative changes were evaluated by Mann-Whitney
There were no complications including re-dislocation, patella fracture, infection, and joint contracture.
The apprehension test was positive in 4.2% post-operatively.
A statistically significant improvement in clinical scores and radiographic evaluation were evident after surgery.
Isolated MPFL Reconstruction using soft suture anchor and adjustable cortical fixation system led good restoration of patellar stability and significant improvement of knee function in short-term results.
This surgical technique can reduce complications such as patella fractures, and can be done safely.
This technique may be a treatment option with little associated complications in the treatment for patellar instability.
