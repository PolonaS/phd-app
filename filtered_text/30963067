Overuse injuries of the extensor mechanism of the knee are common in both athletes and non-athletes and usually occur during activities associated with repetitive loading, stress, and knee extension.
Numerous reports have been published describing extensor mechanism injuries in athletes, but there is a paucity of studies that focus on quadriceps tendinopathy in the non-athlete population.
In addition, there is no universally accepted classification system for tendon pathology.
Therefore, we performed a comprehensive literature review of these studies.
This review consists of 2 parts.
In the previous part we reviewed: (I) epidemiology and (II) diagnosis of quadriceps tendinopathy in the athlete as well as the general population.
In this part we discuss: (I) classification; (II) prognosis; and (III) treatment results.
