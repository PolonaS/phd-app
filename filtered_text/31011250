 (ALL) was recently described as an important structure to control the pivot-shift phenomenon in the knee.
Doubts remain regarding its origin and histological properties.
The purpose of this study was to identify the ALL histological structure comparing its characteristics with those of the anterior cruciate ligament  and joint capsule.
ALL was harvested in 25 knees during a total knee arthroplasty  and histologically evaluated investigating for orientation of fibers, adipose tissue, presence of proprioceptors and synovial like coating.
Analysis showed significant differences in several aspects between capsule and ALL; analogies were found comparing the ALL with ACL.
