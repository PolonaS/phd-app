The "11+ Kids" injury prevention programme has shown to reduce injuries and related costs in youth football players under 14 years of age.
A major argument to convince coaches to use this exercise-based injury prevention programme, is a potential performance enhancement of the players.
Therefore, this study investigated the effects of the "11+ Kids" programme on isokinetic strength.
Two teams were randomly assigned to the intervention and control group.
The intervention group replaced their warm-up by the "11+ Kids" and the control group warmed-up as usual.
Two days before and after the 10-week intervention, isokinetic strength of the hip adductors and abductors, knee flexors and extensors, and ankle invertors and evertors was tested.
Thirty-one players (mean age 11.5 Â± 0.8 years) completed the study.
The intervention group showed large improvements in all isokinetic strength measures (p < 0.001 for all measures, Cohen's d 0.8 to 1.4), whereas the control group only showed negligible to medium positive effects (p-values from 0.006 to 0.718, Cohen's d -0.1 to 0.7).
The intervention was beneficial compared to the control group regarding isokinetic strength of the hip adductors (p < 0.001), knee flexors (p = 0.002), as well as ankle evertors (p < 0.001) and invertors (p = 0.005).
Given the relatively short intervention period of 10 weeks, the observed improvements relate to a practically meaningful effect of the intervention.
The gain in strength may improve players' performance and may contribute to a reduction of injury risk in the long-term application.
