Increasing evidence indicates that osteoarthritis  is a musculoskeletal disease affecting the whole joint, including both cartilage and subchondral bone.
Reactive oxygen species  have been demonstrated to be one of the important destructive factors during early-stage OA development.
The objective of this study was to investigate  (Iso) treatment on osteoclast formation and chondrocyte protection to attenuate OA by modulating ROS.
Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand  was used to establish the osteoclast differentiation model in  (BMMs) in vivo.
