Although chronic airflow limitation  is an important long-term consequence of tuberculosis , little is known about the disease process.
We present what we believe to be the first case of histologically confirmed residual TB-associated obstructive pulmonary disease  in a 23-year-old non-smoking man who developed severe CAL after one episode of TB, with no other plausible risk factors.
Lung biopsies identified residual post-TB pathology affecting the small airways and vessels throughout his lung; this has not been reported previously.
These findings strengthen the argument that TOPD may be a phenotype of CAL distinct from both smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis.
