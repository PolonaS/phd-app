A 13-year-old female gymnast presented with medial knee pain despite several months of nonoperative management for a valgus hyperextension injury resulting in a bony avulsion fracture of the medial collateral ligament  origin at the medial femoral condyle.
The MCL was repaired via  (ORIF) with a single 4.0 mm cannulated screw and washer.
ORIF is a successful treatment option for extra-articular bony MCL origin avulsion fractures that fail conservative treatment.
Following surgical intervention and structured physical therapy, our patient had full return to sports at 10 months.
