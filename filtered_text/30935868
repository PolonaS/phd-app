To evaluate if synovial inflammation and hypervascularization are present in a dog model of knee osteoarthritis and can be detected on conventional magnetic resonance imaging ,  (DCE-MRI),  (CE-MRI), and  (Q-DSA) imaging.
Six dogs underwent MRI and angiography of both knees before and 12 weeks after right knee anterior cruciate ligament injury.
Synovial vascularity was evaluated on CE-MRI, DCE-MRI, and Q-DSA by 2 independent observers.
Synovial inflammation and vascularity were histologically scored independently.
Cartilage lesions and osteophytes were analyzed macroscopically, and cartilage volumetry was analyzed by MRI.
Vascularity and osteoarthritis markers on imaging were compared before and after osteoarthritis generation, and between the osteoarthritis model and the control knee, using linear mixed models accounting for within-dog correlation.
In all knees, baseline imaging showed no abnormalities.
Control knees did not develop significant osteoarthritis changes, synovial inflammation, or hypervascularization.
In osteoarthritis knees, mean synovial enhancement score on CE-MR imaging increased by 13.1 ± 0.59 (P < .0001); mean synovial inflammation variable increased from 47.33 ± 18.61 to 407.97 ± 18.61 on DCE-MR imaging (P < .0001); and area under the curve on Q-DSA increased by 1058.58 ± 199.08 (P = .0043).
Synovial inflammation, hypervascularization, and osteophyte formations were present in all osteoarthritis knees.
Histology scores showed strong correlation with CE-MR imaging findings (Spearman correlation coefficient [SCC] = 0.742; P = .0002) and Q-DSA findings (SCC = 0.763; P < .0001) and weak correlation with DCE-MR imaging (SCC = -0.345; P = .329).
Moderate correlation was found between CE-MR imaging and DSA findings (SCC = 0.536; P = .0004).
In this early-stage knee osteoarthritis dog model, synovial inflammation and hypervascularization were found on imaging and confirmed by histology.
