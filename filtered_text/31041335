 (ACI) is an established method for treating cartilage defects in the knee of adult patients.
However, less is known about its effectiveness in adolescents.
Third-generation matrix-associated ACI  using spheroids (co.don chondrosphere/Spherox) is an effective and safe treatment for articular cartilage defects in adolescents aged 15 to 17 years, with outcomes comparable with those for young adults aged 18 to 34 years.
Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.
A total of 71 patients (29 adolescents, 42 young adults) who had undergone ACI using spheroids were evaluated retrospectively in this multicenter study.
For adolescents, the mean defect size was 4.6 ± 2.4 cm
No significant difference between the 2 study groups was found for KOOS, IKDC, or MOCART scores, with all patients achieving high functional values.
A significant difference was found in the modified Lysholm score, favoring the young adult group over the adolescent group (22.3 ± 1.9 vs 21.0 ± 2.4, respectively;
Third-generation MACI using spheroids is a safe and effective treatment for large cartilage defects of the knee in adolescents at midterm follow-up.
Outcomes are comparable with those for young adults after ACI.
