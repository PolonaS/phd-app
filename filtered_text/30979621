To evaluate the effects of the femoral tunnel location in the femoral footprint of the anterior cruciate ligament  on postoperative knee stability and clinical outcomes after ACL reconstruction  using the outside-in technique.
From December 2012 to August 2014, ACLR was performed using the outside-in technique in 137 patients.
Among these patients, those who had a follow-up period of over 2 years were retrospectively reviewed.
A total of 102 patients met the inclusion criteria.
The relative location of the femoral tunnel in the lateral condyle was evaluated as a percentage using the standardized grid system on a 3-dimensional computed tomography image.
Each patient was then classified into the anterior group, center group (anteroposterior plane, 29.3% ± 3.5%), or posterior group depending on the location of the femoral tunnel.
Knee laxity was evaluated using a GNRB knee arthrometer, stress radiography, and the pivot-shift test.
From a clinical perspective, patient-reported outcomes (International Knee Documentation Committee subjective form and Lysholm knee score) were then evaluated.
Of 102 patients, 31 (30.4%) were assigned to the anterior group, 46 (45.1%) were assigned to the center group, and 25 (24.5%) were assigned to the posterior group.
Postoperative side-to-side differences, which were measured using stress radiographs and the GNRB arthrometer, were significantly smaller in the posterior group (1.7 ± 0.6 mm and 1.5 ± 0.5 mm, respectively) than in the center group (2.3 ± 0.9 mm and 2.2 ± 2.8 mm, respectively) and anterior group (2.4 ± 0.7 mm and 2.4 ± 1.3 mm, respectively) (P = .002 for stress radiography and P = .002 for GNRB arthrometer).
No significant between-group differences were observed in the pivot-shift test results and patient-reported outcomes among the 3 groups.
The location of the femoral tunnel in the anatomic ACL footprint did not affect postoperative stability and clinical outcomes in the case of ACLR using the outside-in technique.
Level III, retrospective comparative study.
