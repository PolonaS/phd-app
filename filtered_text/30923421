To highlight the incidence of grade III PCL injuries with simultaneous PCL & popliteus injury.
Inclusion criteria: patients who underwent PCL reconstruction for grade III PCL tear & minimum of 1-year follow-up.
Exclusion criteria: associated ACL injury & insufficient follow up.
Patients seen postoperatively at 2 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 4-6 months, 6-9 months, 1 year, and 1 + years.
89.5% of patients in this study had an associated popliteus injury.
Isolated grade III PCL injury may not frequently exist, rather undiagnosed & untreated concurrent popliteus injury can have less successful outcomes after isolated PCL reconstruction.
