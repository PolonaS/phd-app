 (US) has become a useful instrument in evaluating musculoskeletal pathology.
Recent studies suggest that US imaging of weight-bearing menisci may enhance the assessment of knee pathology, such as  (OA) and meniscal injuries.
The primary aim of this study was to determine the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of US measurements of medial meniscal extrusion  after a brief training session.
Prospective SETTING: Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department within a tertiary care institution.
