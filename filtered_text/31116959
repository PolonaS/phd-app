Airway mucin overproduction is the hallmark risk factor of asthma, which is associated with the reduction of lung function.
An aberrant mucin expression is responsible for airway obstruction due to its high viscous characteristics.
Among the mucins discovered, MUC5AC is the prime mucin of airway epithelia.
Nowadays, mucins induced asthma and  (COPD) are a great concern all over the world.
This review focuses on the effects of natural compounds that can be beneficial to explore new drugs to halt MUC5AC secretion and production in airway epithelial, and also their underlying molecular mechanisms based on recent studies.
Several researchers are seeking natural sources to identify a new potent MUC5AC inhibitory agent for clinical applications, because of countable limitations of existing synthetic drugs.
Currently, flavonoids, glycoside and steroids like natural compounds have acquired great attention due to their anti-inflammatory and mucoregulatory effects.
Most importantly, many natural compounds have shown their potential effects as the modulator of mucin expression, secretion, and production.
Therefore, targeting airway MUC5AC expression and production represents an auspicious area of research for the development of drugs against various respiratory diseases.
