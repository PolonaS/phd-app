The  (ITB) is a suitable scaffold for  (ACL) reconstruction, providing a sufficient mechanical resistance to loading.
Hence, ITB-derived fibroblasts attract interest for ligament tissue engineering but have so far not been characterized.
This present study aimed at characterizing ITB fibroblasts before, during, and after emigration from cadaveric ITB explants to decipher the emigration behavior and to utilize their migratory capacity for seeding biomaterials.
ITB and, for comparison, ACL tissues were assessed for the content of alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) expressing fibroblasts and degeneration.
The cell survival and αSMA expression were monitored in explants used for cell isolation, monolayer, self-assembled ITB spheroids, and spheroids seeded in polyglycolic acid  scaffolds.
The protein expression profile of targets typically expressed by ligamentocytes (collagen types I-III, elastin, lubricin, decorin, aggrecan, fibronectin, tenascin C, CD44, β1-integrins, vimentin, F-actin, αSMA, and vascular endothelial growth factor A [VEGFA]) was compared between ITB and ACL fibroblasts.
A donor- and age-dependent differing percentage of αSMA positive cells could be detected, which was similar in ITB and ACL tissues despite the grade of degeneration being significantly higher in the ACL due to harvesting them from OA knees.
ITB fibroblasts survived for several months in an explant culture, continuously forming monolayers with VEGFA and an increased αSMA expression.
They shared their expression profile with ACL fibroblasts.
αSMA decreased during the monolayer to spheroid/scaffold transition.
Using self-assembled spheroids, the migratory capacity of reversible myofibroblastic ITB cells can be utilized for colonizing biomaterials for ACL tissue engineering and to support ligament healing.
