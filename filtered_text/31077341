The bronchodilator tiotropium is shown to not only bind to its main binding site on the M
Acetylcholine, tiotropium and atropine binding to the M
Molecular dynamics simulation revealed extracellular vestibule binding of tiotropium, and not atropine, to the M
We propose that tiotropium has two binding sites at the M
