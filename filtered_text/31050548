Abnormal expression of lncRNAs has been confirmed to be associated with many diseases, including  (COPD).
For better understanding the mechanism of COPD, we investigated the lncRNA and mRNA profiles in the lung tissue of COPD patients.
According to the analysis, one of the significantly different lncRNA COPDA1 might participate in the occurrence and development of COPD.
Lung tissues collected from nonsmokers, smokers, or smokers with COPD for RNA-seq.
Bioinformatics analysis and cell experiments were employed to define the function of COPDA1 and the effects of COPDA1 on intracellular Ca2+ concentration and cell proliferation were examined after knockdown or overexpression of COPDA1.
A number of variational lncRNAs were found in the comparison of nonsmokers, smokers, and smokers with COPD.
GO and KEGG analyses indicated that smoking was involved in the activation of cytokines and the cell cycle, which is associated with COPD.
According to the lncRNA-mRNA co-expressing network and enrichment analysis, COPDA1 and one of its target gene MS4A1 were investigated, we discovered the expression of MS4A1 was closely associated with lncRNA COPDA1 expression in HBSMCs.
Further study showed that lncRNA COPDA1 upregulated the expression of MS4A1 to increase store-operated calcium entry  in the HBSMCs, resulting in the promotion of the proliferation of smooth muscle cells, as well as the airway remodeling.
COPDA1 might be involved in the regulation of certain signaling pathways in COPD and promote the proliferation of HBSMCs and might also be involved in facilitating airway remodeling.
