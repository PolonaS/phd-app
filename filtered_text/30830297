Graft choice in primary anterior cruciate ligament  reconstruction remains controversial.
The use of allograft has risen exponentially in recent years with the attraction of absent donor site morbidity, reduced surgical time and reliable graft size.
However, the published evidence examining their clinical effectiveness over autograft tendons has been unclear.
The aim of this paper is to provide a current review of the clinical evidence available to help guide surgeons through the decision-making process for the use of allografts in primary ACL reconstruction.
The literature in relation to allograft healing, storage, sterilisation, differences in surgical technique and rehabilitation have been reviewed in addition to recent comparative studies and all clinical systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
