The purpose of this study was to evaluate the positions of femoral bone sockets and tibial bone tunnels made with the rectangular retro-dilator , which we manufactured for  (ACLR) with a bone-patella tendon-bone  graft which is fixed into the rectangular bone socket and tunnel made at anatomical ACL insertion sites.
42 patients who had undergone ACLR with BPTB using the RRD were evaluated to assess bone socket and tunnel positions by the quadrant method and Magnussen classification using three-dimensional (3-D) CT. Intra-operative complications were also investigated in all patients.
3-D CT of the operated knee joints using the RRD showed that the bone socket and tunnel were placed in anatomical positions.
In the quadrant method, the mean position of the femoral bone socket aperture was located at 22.0 ± 4.2% along the Blumensaat's line, and 37.4 ± 7.2% across the posterior condylar rim.
The mean positions of the tibial bone tunnel aperture were 37.7 ± 5.2% and 46.1 ± 2.2% antero-posteriorly and medio-laterally, respectively.
In addition, according to the Magnussen classification, 39 cases were evaluated as type 1, and almost all were located behind the lateral intercondylar ridge (also known as the resident's ridge).
3 cases were classified as type 2, which overlapped with the resident's ridge.
A partial fracture of BPTB bone fragment was observed in 2 patients, but no serious complications including neurovascular injury were observed.
The study indicates that the use of RRD achieves a safe anatomical reconstruction of the ACL.
