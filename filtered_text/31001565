A longer operative time has been previously recognized as a risk factor for short-term complications after various orthopaedic procedures; however, it has yet to be investigated as an independent risk factor for postoperative complications after anterior cruciate ligament  reconstruction.
To identify whether a longer operative time in ACL reconstruction is an independent risk factor for the development of postoperative complications, hospital readmissions, or an extended length of stay within 30 days of the index procedure.
Descriptive epidemiology study.
Patients undergoing ACL reconstruction between 2005 and 2016 were identified using the  (ACS-NSQIP) database.
Cases with concomitant procedures were excluded from the analysis.
We evaluated the association between operative time and preoperative variables such as patient age, sex, body mass index, comorbidities, and procedure.
Correlations between adverse events and operative time, while controlling for the above preoperative variables, were calculated using multivariate Poisson regression with robust error variance.
A total of 14,159 procedures were included in this investigation.
The mean patient age was 32.6 ± 10.8 years, the mean body mass index was 27.7 ± 6.5 kg/m
While the overall adverse risk rate after ACL reconstruction remains low, marginal increases in operative time are associated with an increased risk of adverse events such as deep vein thrombosis, surgical site infections, sepsis, an extended length of stay, and readmissions.
Thus, the operating physician and surgical staff should make all efforts to coordinate and prepare for each case to maximize surgical efficiency.
