 (HF) and  (COPD) represent the most important differential diagnoses of dyspnea in elderly people.
Heart failure is the inability of the heart to pump sufficient amounts of blood through the cardiovascular system.
Pump failure is caused by compromised contractility and/or filling of the ventricles leading to forward and backward failure and subsequently to dyspnea.
In COPD, the destruction and remodeling processes of the bronchiolar architecture inhibit proper exhalation of air, thereby leading to exhaustion of the thoracic muscles, insufficient oxygen diffusion, and dyspnea.
Despite these fundamental differences in the pathophysiology of both disorders, their clinical presentation may be very similar.
This renders accurate and timely diagnosis and therapy, especially in patients with coexisting disease, difficult.
This clinical review summarizes typical problems in the diagnosis of COPD, HF, and coincident disease, and describes strategies that help avoid misdiagnosis and ineffective treatment.
