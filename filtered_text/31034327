This study investigated the contact forces and muscle activation during two choreographed fall techniques in contemporary dancers and how these were affected by the fall technique.
Ten collegiate level dancers were instructed in two choreographed falls: a) an anteriorly-focused fall involving ankle plantar flexion, knee flexion, and hip flexion with dispersion of forces up the anterior surface of the shank (Technique 1); and (b) a laterally-focused fall involving inversion at the ankle with dispersion of forces up the lateral aspect of the shank (Technique 2).
The knee and hip contact forces were 26.3% smaller (Technique 1: 1743 N versus Technique 2: 1284 N) and 24.1% greater (Technique 1: 1334 N versus Technique 2: 1656 N), respectively, in Technique 2 (p<0.034).
At the time of knee contact, percent maximal voluntary isometric contraction (%MVIC) was 45.8% greater for rectus femoris muscle (Technique 1: 7.2% versus Technique 2: 10.5%), and 96.9% greater for gluteus medius muscle (Technique 1: 3.2% versus Technique 2: 6.3%) (p<0.014) in Technique 2.
The results provide insight to determine safer landing strategies to avoid knee injuries in individuals who experience a fall (i.e., dancers, athletes and older adults).
