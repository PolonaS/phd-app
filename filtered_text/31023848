CCSP knockout mice exhibit increased airway neutrophilia, as found in COPD.
We therefore investigated whether treating COPD airway epithelia with rhCCSP could dampen exaggerated airway neutrophilia.Control, smoker and COPD  (ALI) cultures exposed to Cigarette Smoke Extract  were treated with and without rhCCSP.
The chemotactic properties of their supernatants were assessed by Dunn chambers.
Neutrophil chemotaxis along rhIL8 gradients (with/without rhCCSP) was also determined.
rhCCSP-rhIL8 interactions were tested through co-immunoprecipitation, Biacore- (SPR) and
