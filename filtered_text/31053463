To report the subjective outcomes and objective stability in a series of chronically grade III posterolateral injured knees treated with a hamstring-based anatomic posterolateral corner  reconstruction technique using autografts.
An outcome study of patients with a chronic complete tear of all ligamentous structures of the PLC (>5 mm of varus gapping at 30
Twenty-nine of 33 patients were available for follow up at an average of 31.9 ± 12.3 months (range, 24-59 months) postoperatively.
Twenty-five patients underwent multiple-ligament reconstruction without prior osteotomy.
No patient had an isolated PLC knee reconstruction.
The average comparative preoperative and postoperative outcomes were, respectively: Lysholm: 49.7 ± 10.3, 81.2 ± 12.8, P < .001, 89.7% met minimal detectable change; IKDC: 36.7 ± 8.3, 70.4 ± 19.8, P < .001, 82.8% met minimal clinically important difference; Tegner, 6.6 ± 1.3, 5.5 ± 1.6, P < .001; and varus stress radiograph: 7.1 ± 3.1 mm, 1.8 ± 1.8 mm, P < .001.
A significant improvement, P < .001, was found between preoperative and postoperative IKDC objective scores for varus opening at 0° and 30° and external rotation measured by the dial test at 30°.
Recurvatum was also improved: preoperatively, 52% had a low-grade and 48% had a high-grade recurvatum, whereas postoperatively, 100% were classified as low grade, P < .001.
The presented anatomic PLC reconstruction, concomitant to other surgical procedures and ligament reconstructions, is a valid technique in a multiligamentous knee injury involving the PLC, improving subjective outcomes and objective stability in patients with a chronic PLC knee injury, similar to historical controls.
