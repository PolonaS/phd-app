The purpose of this study was to diagnose and characterise  (COPD) into its forms, patterns, and severity using MDCT.
In this prospective study, spirometric and MDCT evaluation was done in 52 consecutive patients diagnosed with COPD.
In each patient six segmental bronchi were evaluated for CT morphometric indices of bronchial wall thickness  and wall area percentage .
Quantitative evaluation of emphysema was done using inbuilt software, and volume of emphysematous lung was determined using percentage  (LAA).
COPD was categorised into the following: emphysema predominant; airway predominant; or mixed phenotypes, and severity grading was assigned as mild, moderate, or severe.
Centrilobular was the predominant emphysema pattern occurring alone (36.5%) or in combination with paraseptal changes (34.6%).
Among COPD phenotypes, emphysema predominant was the commonest (44.3%), followed by mixed (30.8%), and bronchitis predominant (25.0%).
The mean BWT in the airway-predominant group was significantly higher (1.94 ± 0.28 mm) than in the emphysema-predominant subgroup (1.79 ± 0.23 mm) with a
MDCT is an indispensable tool in quantitative and qualitative evaluation of COPD patients.
Measurement of CT indices like BWT, WAP, and %LAA can reliably categorise COPD into phenotypes like emphysema predominant, airway predominant, or mixed, which serve as a guide for patient management.
