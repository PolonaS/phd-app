 (TCM) is a transient reversible systolic dysfunction, estimated to be the culprit in 1%-2% of patients presenting with clinical symptoms of  (ACS).
TCM was previously thought to be indistinguishable from ACS on the basis of electrocardiogram (EKG) findings; many authors now describe specific EKG changes that distinguish TCM from ACS as well as aid in early recognition of TCM.
This unique case presentation illustrates an uncommon subtype of TCM, and very clearly exemplifies the specific EKG changes meant to aid in distinguishing TCM from ACS.
A bronchogenic subtype of TCM has been proposed, given its prevalence and distinguishing features from TCM without pulmonary pathology; this case exemplifies that notion.
The specific EKG changes of low QRS voltage and attenuation of the amplitude of the QRS complex are now being noted in the EKGs of TCM patients.
This patient presented for worsening shortness of breath and increased productive cough; her EKG revealed ST elevations in leads V3-V6, and low voltage QRS complexes when compared to previous EKG from 12 wk ago; troponin peaked at 5.16 ng/mL.
Left heart catheterization did not reveal significant lesions and left ventriculogram findings were consistent with TCM.
Patient was treated for COPD exacerbation, her symptoms improved significantly; she was sent home on the appropriate medications.
This case exemplifies EKG changes noted in TCM patients who may aid in early detection and appropriate treatment of TCM.
