Translation and validation of three commonly used knee scores to Arabic language: the  (LKS), the  (OKS), and IKDC Subjective Knee Form.
Our work focused on translation and validation of the LKS, OKS and IKDC.
Construct validity was assessed by comparing the LKS, OKS, and IKDC Subjective Knee Form and previous Arabic translated version of  (KOOS).
Test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity were assessed, using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient , Cronbach's alpha, and Pearson correlation coefficient (r).
Reliability was excellent for the Arabic IKDC subjective form (0.95), while the Arabic LKS and the Arabic OKS were good: 0.8 and 0.85, respectively.
The Cronbach's Î¬ was excellent for the Arabic LKS and Arabic OKS: 0.9 and 0.90, respectively, while the Arabic IKDC subjective form was good (0.89).
Construct validity was high for the Arabic LKS and the Arabic OKS: 0.7 and 0.913, respectively, while the Arabic IKDC was moderate (0.4) in cases of ACL and meniscus injuries and mild (0.18) in cases of osteoarthritis.
Arabic LKS and Arabic OKS were reliable and valid scores for patients complaining of ligamentous injuries, meniscus injuries, and osteoarthritis to be used for Arabic-speaking people, while the Arabic IKDC had excellent reliability and mild validity in cases of osteoarthritis and moderate validity in cases of ACL and meniscus injuries.
