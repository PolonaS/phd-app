Sex differences in incidence, susceptibility and severity of many chronic respiratory diseases have been long recognized.
 (ACO) is newly recognised disease with its management guidelines reported in 2015.
The objective of this analysis is to identify the female-specific risk factors associated with ACO in Aboriginal people.
The Aboriginal Peoples Survey 2012 (N = 28,410) is the fourth cycle of a national cross-sectional survey representative of the First Nations living off reserve, Metis and Inuit.
The 2012 APS collected information on employment, education, health status, housing, family background and income.
Survey Logistic Regression was used to identify the significant risk factors for ACO in the multivariate analysis.
The prevalence of ACO was 1.65% and 3.53% in males and females respectively.
The following factors were significantly associated with increased risk of ACO in both males and females: increased age, living in Quebec, longer hours of work per week, living in a rented dwelling and dwelling in need of major repairs.
However, three factors including marital status (being widowed, separated or divorced), smoking status (being a current daily smoker) and having a diagnosis of diabetes were significantly associated with increased risk of ACO in females not males.
The results of our study may offer useful evidence for future development of female-specific prevention and public health intervention programs in aboriginal communities to reduce the burden of ACO.
