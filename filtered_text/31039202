Canine cutaneous leishmaniasis  is a zoonosis of public health interest, and in the Americas, Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis has been identified as the main etiological agent.
The present study sought to investigate Leishmania spp.
infection in domestic dogs from a rural area of the Xapuri municipality, Acre state, Brazilian Amazonia.
For this purpose, visits were carried out to domiciles where the human cases of American cutaneous leishmaniasis  occurred, followed by the clinical evaluation of the animals in search of clinical signs suggestive of CCL.
Blood samples were collected from 40 dogs, 13 of which had lesions suggestive of CCL, and biopsies of these lesions were performed.
The methods used were Neal,  (NNN) medium cultures and direct parasitological examination.
Further, to detect and characterize Leishmania DNA some molecular techniques were performed such as conventional polymerase chain reaction  and sequencing targeting SSU rDNA and ITS1,  (RFLP) and  (HRM) analysis targeting hsp70.
The investigation revealed that the results obtained from the parasitological methods were negative.
In PCR by ITS1 and network topology sequences, six strains from dogs, isolated from the Peruvian Andes, appeared identical to Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis type 2 (99-100%).
By other molecular methods these samples turned out to be positive to Leishmania (Viannia) sp..
The diagnosis of Leishmania in domestic dogs from Acre state showed a high proportion of infected animals, and the occurrence of L. braziliensis type 2 in Brazil for the first time.
This new report suggests that L. braziliensis type 2 is both trans- and cis-Andean.
However, more studies are needed regarding the clinical and diagnostic aspects of this species of Leishmania.
