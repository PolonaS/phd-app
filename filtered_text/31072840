To estimate knee osteoarthritis  risk following  (ACL), meniscus or combined ACL and meniscus injury.
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
MEDLINE, Embase, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL and Web of Science until November 2018.
Prospective or retrospective studies with at least 2-year follow-up including adults with ACL injury, meniscal injury or combined injuries.
Knee OA was defined by radiographs or clinical diagnosis and compared with the contralateral knee or non-injured controls.
Risk of bias was assessed using the SIGN50 checklist.
ORs for developing knee OA were estimated using random effects meta-analysis.
53 studies totalling ∼1 million participants were included: 185 219 participants with ACL injury, mean age 28 years, 35% females, 98% surgically reconstructed; 83 267 participants with meniscal injury, mean age 38 years, 36% females, 22% confirmed meniscectomy and 73% unknown; 725 362 participants with combined injury, mean age 31 years, 26% females, 80% treated surgically.
The OR of developing knee OA were 4.2 (95% CI 2.2 to 8.0; I
The odds of developing knee OA following ACL injury are approximately four times higher compared with a non-injured knee.
A meniscal injury and a combined injury affecting both the ACL and meniscus are associated with six times higher odds compared with a non-injured knee.
Large inconsistency (eg, study design, follow-up period and comparator) and few high-quality studies suggest that future studies may change these estimates.
Patients sustaining a major knee injury have a substantially increased risk of developing knee OA, highlighting the importance of knee injury prevention programmes and secondary prevention strategies to prevent or delay knee OA development.PROSPERO registration number CRD42015016900.
