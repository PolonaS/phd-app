Meniscal injuries in children can pose treatment challenges, as the meniscus must maintain its biomechanical function over a long lifetime while withstanding a high activity level.
While the adult literature contains a plethora of studies regarding risk factors for failure of meniscal surgery, such reports are scarcer in children.
To determine the rate at which children undergoing meniscal surgery require subsequent reoperation as well as to define risk factors for reoperation in this population.
Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.
A retrospective institutional database of 907 first-time meniscal surgical procedures performed between 2000 and 2015 was reviewed.
All patients were <18 years old.
Demographic and intraoperative information was recorded, as were concurrent injuries or operations and subsequent procedures.
Univariate analysis consisted of chi-square and independent-samples
The mean ± SD patient age was 13.2 ± 2.1 years, and 567 (63%) were male.
The mean postoperative follow-up duration was 20.1 ± 10.1 months.
Overall, 83 patients (9%) required repeat surgery at a mean of 23.2 months after the index operation.
After adjustment for confounders in a multivariate model, meniscal repair resulted in 3.1-times higher odds of reoperation when compared with meniscectomy (95% CI, 1.2-8.3;
Approximately 9% of children undergoing meniscal surgery will require reoperation at a mean 23.2 months after the index operation.
Repair carried approximately 3-times higher odds of reoperation than meniscectomy, while white-white zone tears had nearly 3-times lower odds of requiring repeat surgery when compared with tears in other zones.
