To explore the effectiveness of patellar tendon reconstruction by using LARS artificial ligament in treatment of old patellar tendon rupture.
A clinical data of 12 patients with old patellar ligament ruptures, who met the inclusive criteria and reconstructed with LARS artificial ligament between December 2011 and December 2017, was retrospectively analyzed. There were 8 males and 4 females with an average age of 33.5 years (range, 18-55 years). The cause of injury included traffic accident injury in 4 cases, sport injury in 5 cases, and violent injury in 3 cases. There were 5 cases in the left knee and 7 cases in the right knee. The disease duration was 2-12 weeks (mean, 2.5 weeks). The preoperative Lysholm score and Kujala score were 43.2±3.2 and 43.9±2.6, respectively. The knee range of motion was (106.5±14.7)°. The thigh circumference which was measured at 10 cm above the upper end of the patella was (40.92±1.93) cm. There were 4 cases of patellar ligament body rupture, 1 case of patella distal pola rupture, and 7 cases of tibial tuberosity attachment rupture. Preoperative Caton-Deschamps index was 1.47±0.13.
All patients were followed up 12-30 months (mean, 20.5 months). All incisions healed by first intention. And no complication such as infection, recurrent rupture, and neurovascular injury occurred. At 1 year after operation, the knee range of motion was (131.0±10.2)°, Lysholm score was 87.4±2.4, Kujala score was 88.3±4.8, the thigh circumference which was measured at 10 cm above the upper end of the patella was (42.58±1.93) cm; all showing significant differences when compared with preoperative values ( 
Patellar tendon reconstruction with LARS artificial ligament is an effective method for the old patellar ligament rupture, which can effectively repair the knee extension device and restore knee function.
探讨 LARS 人工韧带重建治疗陈旧性髌韧带断裂的疗效。.
回顾分析 2011 年 12 月—2017 年 12 月收治并符合选择标准的 12 例陈旧性髌韧带断裂患者临床资料，患者均采用 LARS 人工韧带重建治疗。男 8 例，女 4 例；年龄 18～55 岁，平均 33.5 岁。致伤原因：交通事故伤 4 例，运动伤 5 例，暴力伤 3 例。左膝 5 例，右膝 7 例。病程 2～12 周，平均 2.5 周。术前膝关节 Lysholm 评分为（43.2±3.2）分，Kujala 评分为（43.9±2.6）分，膝关节活动度为（106.5±14.7）°，髌上 10 cm 处大腿周径为（40.92±1.93）cm。影像学检查示髌韧带体部断裂 4 例，髌骨下极处断裂 1 例，胫骨结节止点处断裂 7 例；Caton-Deschamps 指数为 1.47±0.13。.
所有患者术后均获随访，随访时间 12～30 个月，平均 20.5 个月。切口均Ⅰ期愈合，无感染、韧带再断裂以及神经血管损伤等并发症发生。术后 1 年，患者膝关节活动度为（131.0±10.2）°，Lysholm 评分为（87.4±2.4）分，Kujala 评分为（88.3±4.8）分，髌上 10 cm 处大腿周径为（42.58±1.93）cm，与术前比较差异均有统计学意义（ 
LARS 人工韧带重建治疗陈旧性髌韧带断裂疗效确切，能够有效修复伸膝装置及恢复膝关节功能。.
