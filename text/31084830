The suprapatellar nailing technique is an important adjunct in the armamentarium of an orthopedic surgeon. Although a variety of new instrumentations are required for insertion of the suprapatellar nail, most companies now carry these instruments. Easier positioning, maintenance of reduction, ease of intraoperative fluoroscopy, more anatomic starting trajectory, decreased malreduction rates, and possible decrease in anterior knee pain are all benefits of suprapatellar nailing, thus making mastery of this technique essential for an orthopedic surgeon.
