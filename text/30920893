Sex plays a role in mediating different susceptibilities and outcomes of disease and injury. Sports injuries are included in this phenomenon, as recent research demonstrates that males and females show differences in incidences of varying injuries, presentations of injury, and treatment outcomes. Incidence of certain sports injuries like anterior cruciate ligament injury or patellofemoral pain syndrome may vary widely between male and female athletes, with female athletes being more susceptible to anterior cruciate ligament injury and patellofemoral pain syndrome. Treatment outcomes for males and females may also vary widely. For example, males have a higher risk of recurrent shoulder instability compared with females. These variances among incidence and outcome following certain injuries highlight the necessity of understanding these differences to provide quality care. It is especially important for the school nurse to be aware of these sex differences as they are well positioned to make youth athletes and their families aware of the varying injury susceptibilities among them.
