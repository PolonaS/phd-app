To identify risk factors for patellofemoral degenerative progression after opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO) and to investigate the effect of patellofemoral degeneration on the patellofemoral specific patient-reported outcomes.
Between March 2010 and June 2016, 94 knees (86 patients) underwent hardware removal with second-look arthroscopy at 21.4 months after opening-wedge HTO with first-look arthroscopy (mean follow-up duration, 49.8 months). Predictive factors for patellofemoral degeneration, including demographics, preoperative and postoperative mechanical axis (MA) of the lower limb (positive and negative MA indicating varus and valgus, respectively), tibial slope, and modified Blackburne-Peel ratio, were evaluated. Patients were divided into the progression and nonprogression groups according to their patellofemoral degenerative progression from first to second arthroscopy. Clinical outcomes, including the Kujala score and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and radiographic outcomes were compared between the 2 groups.
Postoperative MA (adjusted odd ratio, 0.62; P < .001) was the most significant predictive factor for progressive change in the patellofemoral joint (R
Postoperative MA, which might be related to overcorrection, is correlated with patellofemoral degenerative progression after opening-wedge HTO. Patients with patellofemoral degenerative progression showed inferior patient-reported outcomes.
