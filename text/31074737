Studying the relative impact of various measures of coping strategies can help determine which ones are most useful for patients with osteoarthritis (OA).This study prospectively enrolled 108 patients with hip or knee OA who were seeing an orthopedic surgeon before or after arthroplasty. Measures of coping strategies included the Patient Activation Measure (PAM), Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ-2), and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). The Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Junior (HOOS, JR), the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Junior (KOOS, JR), and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) were used to measure pain intensity. Pearson correlations measured the interrelationships of the outcome measures. The PSEQ-2 correlated significantly with the NRS, but the confidence intervals for the three instruments overlapped. The PAM and the PSEQ-2 correlated with the KOOS, JR. Only the PSEQ-2 was associated with variation in the NRS. The PAM, PSEQ-2, and BRS correlated with one another. While measures of self-efficacy, active involvement in care, and general resilience were correlated, the measure of pain self-efficacy had the strongest association with patient-reported outcomes.
