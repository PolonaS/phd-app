This study aimed to determine the effects of single semitendinosus tendon (ST) harvesting for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction by comparing outcomes of single ST and semitendinosus-gracilis tendon (ST-G) harvesting.
ACL reconstruction with ST-G harvesting (D group, n = 60) or single ST harvesting (S group, n = 60) were included according to inclusion criteria. Subjective assessments included subjective International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity scale score. Objective assessments included isokinetic strength and functional tests. These tests were completed at 36 months of follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and second-look arthroscopy findings were evaluated. In the S group, regeneration properties were assessed by serial ultrasonography (US).
The S group showed significantly less deep flexor strength deficit than the D group (
The S group showed significantly less deficit in deep flexor strength and tended to show better clinical results at the last follow-up than the D group. In the S group, more than 80% showed good regeneration at the 6-month follow-up. Hence, single ST harvesting is effective in minimizing flexor weakness and functional deficits and shows great potential for regeneration.
