Long-term gait adaptations after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) have been reported. However, it is still unclear if they persist more than 4 years after surgery and if they are affected by gait speed.
To investigate differences between groups, legs and walking speeds for ankle, knee and hip joint moments in three planes throughout the stance phase of gait.
Reconstructed participants (n = 20 males, 32.5 years, 5.5 years post-ACLR) and healthy controls (n = 20 males, 30.6 years) took part in the study. Gait analysis was performed in two different speeds (self-selected and 30% faster). Sagittal, frontal and transverse plane external moments were measured for ankle, knee and hip and compared throughout the stance phase using 95% confidence intervals. Significant differences were established as a consecutive 5% of gait cycle in which 95% confidence interval did not overlap.
The reconstructed leg did not demonstrate higher joint moments; there were largely no differences while there was lower knee external rotation moment compared to the non-preferred leg of the control group. Higher joint moments were observed during fast speed walking on sagittal plane for knee and hip moments in both groups, and in the frontal and transverse plane for ankle moments.
Gait kinetics appear to be largely normalized at a minimum of 4 years after ACLR. Faster walking speed increase lower extremity joint moments.
