Postnatal development and the physiological loading response of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) complex (ACL proper, entheses, and bony morphology) is not well understood. We tested whether the ACL-complex of two inbred mouse strains that collectively encompass the musculoskeletal variation observed in humans, would demonstrate significant morphological differences following voluntary cage-wheel running during puberty compared to normal cage activity controls. Female A/J and C57BL/6 J (B6) 6-week-old mice were provided unrestricted access to a standard cage-wheel for 4 weeks. A/J-exercise mice showed a 6.3% narrower ACL (p = 0.64), and a 20.1% more stenotic femoral notch (p < 0.01) while B6-exercise mice showed a 12.3% wider ACL (p = 0.10), compared to their respective controls. Additionally, A/J-exercise mice showed a 5.3% less steep posterior medial tibial slope (p = 0.07) and an 8.8% less steep posterior lateral tibial slope (p = 0.07), while B6-exercise mice showed a 9.8% more steep posterior medial tibial slope (p < 0.01) than their respective controls. A/J-exercise mice also showed more reinforcement of the ACL tibial enthesis with a 20.4% larger area (p < 0.01) of calcified fibrocartilage (CF) distributed at a 29.2% greater depth (p = 0.02) within the tibial enthesis, compared to their controls. These outcomes suggest exercise during puberty significantly influences ACL-complex morphology and that inherent morphological differences between these mice, as observed in their less active genetically similar control groups, resulted in a divergent phenotypic outcome between mouse strains.
