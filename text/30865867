Despite advances in technology, graft rupture rates reported in the literature following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery range from 1.8% to 18%. Recent anatomical studies have identified a lateral structure, the anterolateral ligament (ALL), as a potential source of residual pivoting following ACL reconstruction. The purpose of this report is to review the history surrounding the ALL and recent anatomic studies, identify its biomechanical and clinical implications, and develop a practical approach to utilizing it during ACL reconstruction.
An extensive review of the historical and current literature surrounding the identification of the ALL, its biomechanical function, reconstruction, and outcomes of ALL reconstruction was performed.
After the storm of media coverage surrounding the "new ligament" known as the ALL, much attention was focused on cadaveric dissection, biomechanical analysis, and reconstruction of this structure. Several techniques have been described, and currently studies are being performed both retrospectively and prospectively to evaluate the added benefit of ALL reconstruction to the rotational stability of the knee and outcomes after ACL reconstruction.
The ALL is a lateral-based structure that provides rotational stability to the knee in the presence of ACL deficiency. Reconstruction of this ligament may provide added benefit to stability and outcomes following ACL reconstruction in certain patient populations. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to elucidate the true benefit of ALL reconstruction and those patients who should undergo this added procedure.
