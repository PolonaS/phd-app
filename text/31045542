Previous studies showed that compared with single-bundle (SB) precedures, double-bundle (DB) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction perform better.
To make assurance that distance of TT-TG may be altered along with ACL rupture and reconstruction.
Imaging study of 201 patients's related cases by MRI and CT scans.
Compared with the intact knee's overall mean TT-TG value, the mean overall pre/postoperative TT-TG values showed a significant difference. For SB reconstruction, the mean pre/postoperative TT-TG values were 15.67± 2.46 mm and 14.72± 2.48 mm, respectively. Postoperative and intact knee TT-TG values were significantly different (p< 0.001). For DB reconstruction, the pre/postoperative mean TT-TG values were 15.11± 1.99 mm and 13.11± 1.71 mm. Postoperative and intact knee TT-TG values were not significantly different (p= 0.141).
The increased TT-TG value from a ruptured ACL was significantly restored after ACL reconstruction. The TT-TG value after SB reconstruction was still obviously larger than that of the intact knee. It showed no significant difference between the postoperative TT-TG of the DB group and intact knees. The original TT-TG values of the knees were much closer to restoration after DB reconstruction.
