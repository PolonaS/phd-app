The functions of body gradually decrease as the age increases, leading to a higher frequency of incidence of age-related diseases. Diseases associated with aging in the respiratory system include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), asthma, lung cancer, and so on. The mitochondrial dysfunction is not only a sign of aging, but also is a disease trigger. This article aims to explain mitochondrial dysfunction as an aging marker, and its role in aging diseases of lung. We also discuss whether the mitochondria can be used as a target for the treatment of aging lung disease.
