Veno-venous extracorporeal CO
A physiological study of the electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi) response was conducted with varying degrees of extracorporeal CO
Twenty COPD patients (SAPS II 37 ± 5.6, age 57 ± 9 years) treated with vv-ECCO
This study demonstrates for the first time the usefulness of the Edi signal to monitor and guide patients with severe acute exacerbation of COPD on vv-ECCO
