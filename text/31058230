Studying perturbations in the gut ecosystem using animal models of disease continues to provide valuable insights into the role of the microbiome in various pathological conditions. However, understanding whether these changes are consistent across animal models of different genetic backgrounds, and hence potentially translatable to human populations, remains a major unmet challenge in the field. Nonetheless, in relatively limited cases have the same interventions been studied in two animal models in the same laboratory. Moreover, such studies typically examine a single data layer and time point. Here, we show the power of utilizing time series microbiome (16S rRNA amplicon profiling) and metabolome (untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry [LC-MS/MS]) data to relate two different mouse models of atherosclerosis-ApoE
