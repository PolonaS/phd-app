Currently available kinematic tracking systems fail to non-invasively capture the subtle variation in joint and soft tissue kinematics that occur in native, injured, and reconstructed joint states. Micro-CT imaging has the potential as a non-invasive, high-resolution kinematic tracking system, but no dynamic simulators exist to take advantage of this.
The purpose of this work was to develop and assess a novel micro-CT compatible knee joint simulator to quantify the knee joint's response to physiological loading.
The simulator applies closed-loop, load-feedback control over 4 degrees of freedom, and static control over a fifth. Simulator accuracy and repeatability were assessed with a rubber construct, and a human cadaveric knee joint.
The simulator loaded both mediums to within 1 % of the set point, with an inter-trial coefficient of variation below 1 % in all loading cases. The resultant kinematics calculated from the acquired images agreed with previously published values, and demonstrated higher spatial resolution. All images were free of artifacts and showed knee joint displacements in response to physiological loading with isotropic CT image resolution of 0.15 mm.
The results of this study demonstrate the potential for this simulator system to contribute to the development of knee joint treatment techniques. Simultaneous, non-invasive kinematic tracking of the homologous bony landmarks and the strains in the soft tissue structures, provides a more complete picture of the interaction of all structures within the joint in various states of injury.
