Autonomic regulation of the heart was examined in 5 groups of rats: intact, sham-operated, experimental chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute cerebral ischemia, and acute cerebral ischemia modeled against the background of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The latter was provoked by combination of inhaled papain and intraperitoneal bacterial LPS, whereas acute cerebral ischemia was modeled by single-stage bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was verified by X-ray computed microtomography. The disturbances in autonomic control of the heart during comorbid pathologies were most prominent; they were manifested by overstrain and decompensation of the mechanisms implicated in the heart control and systolic-diastolic arterial hypotension. The correlations were established between blood oxygenation, respiration rate, and some parameters of autonomic cardiac regulation. The data attest to relevance and usefulness of the developed model of respiratory and cerebrovascular comorbidity in assessment of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying dysregulation of the heart and the development of personalized approaches for its pharmacological correction.
