Although bronchodilator inhaler therapy can improve lung function in patients with tuberculous destroyed lung (TDL), its effect on mortality has not been studied. We evaluated the effect of tiotropium inhaler therapy on mortality in patients with TDL.
A retrospective cohort of 963 patients with TDL was followed for up to ten years by linking hospital and nationwide health insurance claims data. We compared patients receiving tiotropium inhaler with patients without tiotropium after matching with propensity scores. In addition, we elucidated the risk factors of mortality using Cox proportional hazards model.
After the propensity score matching, the baseline characteristics were balanced in both the tiotropium group (n = 105) and the non-tiotropium group (n = 105); including mean age (63.9 vs. 64.4 years, P = 0.715), mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV
Our results suggest that tiotropium inhaler is associated with decreased all-cause mortality in TDL. Further prospective study is required for validation.
