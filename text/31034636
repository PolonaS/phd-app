After anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) there is a higher re-injury rate to the contralateral limb in athletes who undergo surgery using a bone-patellar-tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft than using a semitendinosus and gracilis hamstring tendon (HT) autograft. This may be influenced by differing lower-limb loading asymmetries present when athletes of each graft type return to play. The aim of this study was to compare bilateral countermovement jump (CMJ) phase-specific impulse asymmetries between athletes with BPTB and HT autografts nine months post-ACLR, and to identify the relationship between impulse and isokinetic strength asymmetries. Male field sport athletes with a BPTB (n=22) or HT (n=22) autograft were tested approximately nine months post-ACLR. An uninjured control group (n=22) was also tested on a single occasion. Phase-specific bilateral absolute impulse asymmetries were calculated during the CMJ and compared between groups using Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc testing. A linear regression model was used to assess the relationship between impulse asymmetries and isokinetic concentric knee extensor strength asymmetries. BPTB athletes demonstrated greater impulse asymmetries than HT athletes during the eccentric (p=0.01) and concentric (p=0.008) phases of the jump. Isokinetic strength asymmetry was a significant predictor of CMJ concentric impulse asymmetry in both BPTB (r
