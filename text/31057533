Interleukin 33 (IL-33) is an alarmin cytokine from the IL-1 family. IL-33 is localized in the nucleus and acts there as a gene regulator. Following injury, stress or cell death, it is released from the nucleus, and exerts its pro-inflammatory biological functions via the transmembrane form of the ST2 receptor, which is present mainly as attached to immune cells. In recent years, IL-33 became a focus of many studies due to its possible role in inflammatory disorders. Among respiratory disorders, the contribution of IL-33 to the development of asthma, in particular, has been most identified. Increased level of IL-33 in lung epithelial cells and blood serum has been observed in asthma patients. The IL-33/ST2 interaction activated the Th2 mediated immune response and further production of many pro-inflammatory cytokines. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL-33 gene cause a predisposition to the development of asthma. Similarly, in chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD), both increased expression of IL-33 and the ST2 receptor has been observed. Interestingly, cigarette smoke, a key inducer of COPD, not only activates IL-33 production by epithelial and endothelial cells, but also induces the expression of IL-33 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Knowledge regarding its contribution in other respiratory disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, remains greatly limited. Recently it was shown that IL-33 is one of the inflammatory mediators by which levels in blood serum are increased in OSA patients, compared to healthy control patients. This mini review summarizes current knowledge on IL-33 involvement in chosen chronic respiratory disorders and proposes this interleukin as a possible link in the pathogenesis of these diseases.
