There are limited data on home mechanical ventilation (HMV) in developing countries. This study aimed to describe the patient characteristics, feasibility, and outcomes of an HMV program at a university hospital in Thailand.
Data were collected on all patients who were discharged with HMV between October 2014 and August 2015 at Thammasat University Hospital.
Twelve patients (eight men and four women) underwent HMV. They were aged 71.5 ± 17.6 years; mean ± standard deviation. Indications for HMV were 6 neurologic diseases (4 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 1 multiple system atrophy, and 1 stroke), 2 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 1 tracheomalacia, and 3 combined neurologic diseases and respiratory diseases (2 stroke and COPD, 1 stroke and tracheomalacia). The duration of follow-up was 799.5 ± 780.5 days. The ratio of family income to cost of HMV usage was 77.2:1 ± 5.5:1. All patients had tracheostomies. Modes of HMV were biphasic positive airway pressure (66.7%), pressure-controlled ventilation (16.7%), pressure-support ventilation (8.3%), and volume-controlled ventilation (8.3%). Complications occurred in ten patients (83.3%), including tracheobronchitis (20 events) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (12 events). Overall mortality was 41.7% (5/12 patients), including two patients who died due to ventilator-associated pneumonia. There were no instances of ventilator malfunction.
HMV is feasible for patients with neurological diseases and COPD in a developing country. The relatively high rate of complications indicates the need for more comprehensive clinical services for chronic ventilator-dependent patients in this setting.
