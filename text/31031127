The practice of 'vancomycin wrapping' of harvested hamstring autografts during Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACLR) surgery has gathered recent interest. This practice involves the wrapping of harvested grafts in a vancomycin-soaked swab during the preparatory phase. Different techniques are observed, and a small number of studies have shown that pre-soaking hamstring ACLR grafts in this manner dramatically reduces the post-surgical infection rate compared with standard intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis alone. However, the literature surrounding this practice is surprisingly limited and thus the basis and rationale of the 'vancomycin wrap' has established itself largely without question. The exact popularity of this practice is difficult to establish but there has been increasing disclosure of its efficacy in reducing post-operative infection in ACLR since 2012. We provide a synopsis of the current literature surrounding vancomycin and its use in 'wraps' in ACLR to help apprise the surgeon of the nature of infection in ACLR, the rationale for vancomycin, whilst considering evidence to support alternatives and discussing potential ramifications for future practice.
