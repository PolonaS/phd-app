Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are frequent, as >200,000 injuries occur in the United States alone each year. Owing to the risks for associated meniscus and cartilage damage, ACL injuries are a significant source of both orthopedic care and research. Given the extended recovery course after ACL injury, which often lasts 1-2 years, and is associated with limited participation in sports and activities of daily living for patients, there is a critical need for the evolution of new and improved methods for ACL repair. Subsequently, animal models of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) play a key role in the development and initial trialing of novel ACL interventions. This article provides a clear operative description and associated illustrations for a validated, institutional animal care and use committee, and veterinarian approved and facile model of ACLR to serve researchers investigating ACLR.
