This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of lung transplant recipients requiring additional pleural drainage catheters early post lung transplantation and to determine the safety and efficacy of intrapleural fibrinolytics in these patients.
A retrospective review of lung transplant recipients at a single center was performed. Patient and transplant characteristics, placement of pleural drainage catheters within 90 days of transplant, and use of intrapleural fibrinolytics were determined.
Out of 128 patients who underwent lung transplantation, 54 patients required 86 additional chest tubes, the majority of which were size 14 French or smaller. Pleural effusion was the most common indication for tube placement. Patients who required additional chest tubes were more likely to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than those who did not. Use of intrapleural fibrinolytics led to radiographic improvement in 77.8% of patients and was not associated in bleeding, pneumothorax, or mortality within 30 days.
Use of small bore chest tubes and intrapleural fibrinolytics can be safe and effective in lung transplant recipients with persistent pleural effusions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
