Competitive alpine skiers are subject to substantial risks of injury, especially concerning the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). During "landing back weighted" episodes, hamstrings may partially counteract the anterior shear force acting on the tibia by eccentrically resisting the boot-induced drawer of the tibia relative to the femur. The aim of the present study was to provide novel descriptive data and sport-specific reference values on maximal eccentric hamstrings strength (MEHS) in competitive alpine skiers from youth to elite level, and to explore potential relationships with sex, age and biological maturation. 170 competitive alpine skiers were investigated: 139 youth athletes (51 females, 88 males; age: 13.8 ± 0.59 years) and 31 elite athletes (19 females, 12 males; age: 21.7 ± 2.8 years). MEHS was assessed by the (Vald Performance, Newstead, Australia). U15 female skiers presented lower MEHS compared to female elite skiers for both limbs (
