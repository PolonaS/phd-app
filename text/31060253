Roflumilast is an orally available inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 4, which is widely used in chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. However, it has low solubility and adverse effects include diarrhea and nausea. Since its solubilization may improve treatment and, dismissing any adverse effects, its interaction with cyclodextrins (CDs) was studied. The Higuchi-Connors method was used to determine the complexation constant with different CDs, pH values and temperatures. Molecular docking was used to predict interaction between the complexes. An in vitro digestion experiment was carried out to test roflumilast protection. Finally, the photostability of the complex was evaluated. The complex formed with Î²-CD had the highest
