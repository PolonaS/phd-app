We aim to assess if air pollution levels and climatological factors are associated with hospital admissions for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Spain from 2004 to 2013.
We conducted a retrospective study. Information on pollution level and climatological factors were obtained from the Spanish Meteorological Agency and hospitalizations from the Spanish hospital discharge database. A case-crossover design was used to identify factors associated with hospitalizations and in hospital mortality. Postal codes were used to assign climatic and pollutant factors to each patient.
We detected 162,338 hospital admissions for COPD exacerbation. When seasonal effects were evaluated we observed that hospital admissions and mortality were more frequent in autumn and winter. In addition, we found significant associations of temperature, humidity, ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter up to 10 Î¼m in size (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with hospital admissions. Lower temperatures at admission with COPD exacerbation versus 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 weeks prior to hospital admission for COPD exacerbation, were associated with a higher probability of dying in the hospital. Other environmental factors that were related to in-hospital mortality were NO2, O3, PM10 and CO.
Epidemiology of hospital admissions by COPD exacerbation was negatively affected by colder climatological factors (seasonality and absolute temperature) and short-term exposure to major air pollution (NO2, O3, CO and PM10).
