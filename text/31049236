Periprosthetic distal femur fractures can be treated nonoperatively, with open reduction and internal fixation or with more constrained prostheses. Distal femoral replacement is typically a last resort treatment option for comminuted periprosthetic or osteoporotic distal femoral fractures in patients with poor bone stock or resistant nonunions. We report the case of a 54-year-old female with a remote history of bone mulch ACL reconstruction who sustained an intraoperative comminuted bicondylar distal femur fracture during a primary total knee arthroplasty. This patient was treated with a distal femoral replacement and successfully returned to her preoperative function.
