To investigate the effect of sex on measures of quadriceps strength, rate of torque development, and knee function during the first year following ACLR.
Cross-sectional; SETTING: University community; PARTICIPANTS: Sixty individuals (29 men) with unilateral ACLR in the last 12 months.
Participants completed bilateral knee extension maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC, Nm/kg) strength assessments. Rates of torque development (Nm*kg
Women displayed weaker involved limb (Men = 2.72 ± 0.72 Nm*kg
Within the first year after ACLR, women displayed bilateral quadriceps weakness and slower involved limb quadriceps RTD when compared to men. Specific focus on facilitating quadriceps hypertrophy and improving neural drive to the quadriceps is indicated when treating female patients attempting to make a return to sport after ACLR.
