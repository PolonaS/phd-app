Previous studies showed clinical benefit and durable results of osteochondral allograft (OCA) transplantation for the treatment of femoral condyle lesions. However, the majority of these studies are difficult to interpret owing to the mixed results of different techniques and anatomic locations.
To evaluate the outcome of OCA transplantation with thin plug grafts for treatment of isolated femoral condyle osteochondral lesions.
Case series; Level of evidence, 4.
This study included 187 patients (200 knees) who underwent OCA transplantation for isolated osteochondral lesions on the femoral condyle between 1999 and 2014. For all cases, a thin plug technique was used with commercially available surgical instruments and the minimum amount of bone necessary for fixation. Evaluation included International Knee Documentation Committee score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and patient satisfaction. Frequency and type of further surgery were assessed. Failure of the allograft was defined as further surgery involving removal of the allograft.
Mean follow-up was 6.7 years (range, 1.9-16.5 years). The mean age of patients at the time of surgery was 31 years, and 63% were male. The medial femoral condyle was affected in 69% of knees. A single thin plug graft was used in 145 knees (72.5%), and 2 grafts were used in 55 knees (27.5%). Mean allograft area was 6.3 cm
OCA transplantation with a thin plug graft technique is a valuable procedure for the treatment of femoral condyle osteochondral lesions, resulting in significant improvement in clinical scores, high patient satisfaction, and low reoperation and clinical failure rates.
