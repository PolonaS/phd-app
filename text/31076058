Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In contrast to other chronic diseases, COPD is increasing in prevalence and is projected to be the third leading cause of death and disability worldwide by 2030. Recent advances in understanding the underlying pathophysiology of COPD has led to the development of novel targeted therapies (biologics and small molecules) that address the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. In severe asthma, biologics targeting type 2 (T2)- mediated immunity have been successful and have changed the treatment paradigm. In contrast, no biologics are currently licensed for the treatment of COPD. Those targeting non-T2 pathways have not demonstrated efficacy and in some cases raised concerns related to safety. With the increasing recognition of the eosinophil and perhaps T2-immunity possibly playing a role in a subgroup of patients with COPD, T2 biologics, specifically anti-IL-5(R), have been tested and demonstrated modest reductions in exacerbation frequency. Potential benefit was related to the baseline blood eosinophil count. These benefits were small compared with asthma. Thus, whether a subgroup of COPD sufferers might respond to anti-IL-5 or other T2-directed biologics remains to be fully addressed and requires further investigation.
