Negative pressure ventilation (NPV), when used as an adjuvant to pulmonary rehabilitation, improves lung function, increases exercise capacity, and reduces exacerbations. The aim of this study was to determine whether maintenance NPV improves long-term clinical outcomes and reduces mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Between 2003 and 2009, 341 patients were treated for COPD either with or without hospital-based NPV. We measured forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV
