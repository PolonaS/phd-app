Ventilation/perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography performed using an aerosol of carbon-coated technetium is frequently used for diagnosing pulmonary embolism. Certain patients may suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); for such patients, the formation of mucus clots in airways can cause accumulation of the aerosol in the larger airways. This centralized deposition of the aerosol leads to insufficient activity in peripheral lung segments and subsequently results in ventilation images of substandard or even nondiagnostic quality. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy improves airway dynamics and quality of life for COPD patients. We report for the first time the results for two patients for whom initial ventilation scans were of insufficient quality, but diagnostic-quality images were obtained after CPAP therapy.
