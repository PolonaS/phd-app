The aim of this study was to evaluate the state of the vascular wall in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) combined with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD).
The study included 108 patients: 37 patients with COPD and CAD and 71 patients with COPD without CAD. Endothelial function was studied in tests with reactive hyperemia and nitroglycerin. The number of blood plasma desquamated endotheliocytes were determined by the Hladovec method. In patients with COPD identified are signs of vascular wall remodeling: thickening wall of the brachial artery, reduction of the flow-mediated vasodilation. Patients with COPD in combination with CHD demonstrated higher impairments of the vasoregulatory dysfunction of endothelial of the vascular wall.
In patients with COPD combined with chronic coronary heart disease more pronounced endothelial dysfunction with disturbance of endothelium-dependent vasomotor reactions.
