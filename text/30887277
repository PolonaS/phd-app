Hyperprolactinemia (HPRL) has been reported in many autoimmune diseases. However, the serum autoantibody profile and peripheral B-cell subset distribution in women with HPRL are largely unknown. The current study aimed to investigate the autoantibody prevalence and cytokine levels as well as to further explore the B-cell subset distribution in women with HPRL.
Sera from 202 women with HPRL and 97 healthy women were included in this study. All sera were examined for prolactin (PRL), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor, anticardiolipin (ACL), immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, complement 3, complement 4, interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Peripheral blood was collected from 22 women with HPRL and 19 healthy women, and B-cell subsets were measured by flow cytometry.
At least one autoantibody was found in 47 out of 202 women with HPRL compared with 9 of 97 healthy women (p < 0.001). The levels of IL-4 (p < 0.0001) and IL-6 (p < 0.0001) were significantly higher in women with HPRL than in healthy women. The percentages of naive IgD
Women with HPRL had a higher prevalence of autoantibodies, higher serum levels of IL-4 and IL-6, and more B
