In team sports, non-contact ACL and MCL injuries occur during abrupt changes of direction, like turns or cutting manoeuvres. Fatigue affects dynamic neuromuscular control and increases knee injury risk. This study analysed how lower limb joints and centre-of-mass kinematics are affected throughout a high-intensity running protocol involving repeated 180°-turns. Twenty young men (18-23 years, BMI: 20.8-24.4 kg m
