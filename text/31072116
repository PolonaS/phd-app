Osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) is a successful knee joint preservation technique; however, the effects of defect size and defect size:condyle ratio (DSCR) are poorly understood.
To quantify clinical outcomes of isolated OCA of the knee based on defect size and DSCR.
Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.
Data from patients who underwent OCA of the knee without major concomitant procedures by a single surgeon were analyzed at a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Osteochondral defect size was measured intraoperatively, and femoral condyle size was measured with preoperative imaging. Patient-reported outcomes, reoperations, and survival rates were analyzed per defect size and DSCR, comparing males and females and patients <40 and ≥40 years old.
Sixty-eight patients were included, of whom 57% were male (mean ± SD: age, 34.5 ± 10.3 years; follow-up, 5.2 ± 2.6 years). Mean osteochondral defect size and DSCR were 3.48 ± 1.72 cm
Patients undergoing isolated OCA transplantation demonstrated significant clinical improvements and a graft survival of 88.2% at 5.2 years. Failures overall were associated with a larger DSCR, and failures among patients ≥40 years old with a larger DSCR and larger defect size. Increasing defect size among males was positively correlated with some improved outcomes, although this was not maintained in analysis of the DSCR, suggesting similar prognosis after OCA regardless of sex.
Failed osteochondral allografts are associated with larger defect sizes and defect:condyle ratios in this study, providing additional information to surgeons for appropriate patient consultation.
