This study proposed to access the clinical outcome of avulsion fractures around joints of extremities using the hook plate.
A total of 60 patients with avulsion fractures of joints admitted in our hospital between January 2011 and June 2016 were performed the surgery of hook plate fixation. Functional recovery was evaluated using the Lysholm knee score, Kaikkonen ankle injury score, Mayo elbow and wrist function score, and Neer shoulder function score.
All the patients were healed within 3 months after surgery with stage I healing incision without vascular or nerve injuries. The average follow-up period was 18.1 months. At the last follow-up, no instability of joints, looseness of internal fixation or traumatic arthritis was observed. Mild joint fibrosis occurred in 5 cases. A total of 57 patients were well recovered with the excellent and good rate of 95%. Three patients with humeral avulsion fracture of the greater tuberosity had shoulder joint adhesion and peri humeral inflammation at the last follow-up due to the poor cooperation for early rehabilitation exercise. In the last follow-ups, the functional score of the affected limb was markedly greater than that in the 3-month follow-ups (p < 0.05).
Hook plate fixation has the therapeutic effect on treating avulsion fractures around joints of extremities with the advantages of reliable fixation, early rehabilitation after operation, high recovery rates of joint function, wide indications, and convenient uses.
