To treat anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is currently a standard of the care. However, effect of ACLR graft type including bone patellar tendon bone (BTB), hamstring tendon (HT), or iliotibial band (ITB) on thigh size, knee range of motion (ROM), and muscle strength are understudied.
To compare post-operative thigh circumference, knee ROM, and hip and thigh muscle strength in adolescent males who underwent ACLR, based on the three different autograft types: bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB), hamstring (HS), and iliotibial (ITB).
Biomechanical laboratory.
Male ACLR patients who are younger than 22 years old (Total N=164).
At 6-9 month post-operative visits, thigh circumference, knee ROM, and hip and thigh muscle strength were measured.
Deficits of each variable between the uninvolved and ACLR limb were compared for pediatric and adolescent ACLR males in the BTB, HS, and ITB cohorts. Baseline characteristics including physical demographics and meniscus tear status were compared, and differences identified were treated as covariates and incorporated in analysis of covariance.
Data from 164 adolescent male ACLR patients (mean age: 15.7Â±1.2) at 6-9 months, there were no statistical differences in thigh circumference, knee ROM, hip abductor, and hip extensor strength among the three autografts. However, patients with BTB demonstrated 12.2% deficits in quadriceps strength compared to 0.5% surplus in HS patients (
Adolescent male ACLR patients with BTB and HS autografts demonstrated significant deficits in quadriceps and hamstring strength, respectively, at 6-9 months post-operatively. Minimal lower extremity strength deficits were demonstrated in pediatric male ACLR patients undergoing ITB harvest.
