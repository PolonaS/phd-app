This paper was created by the Austrian Society of Pneumology (Working group Ventilation and Intensive Care) to summarize the specific characteristics of mechanical ventilation in patients presenting with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The main differences in pathophysiology and mechanical ventilation are shown, including acute respiratory failure and out-of-hospital mechanical ventilation.
