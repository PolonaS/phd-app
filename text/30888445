Allografts are frequently use for ligamentous reconstruction at the knee. In the United States, tissue donation and distribution are highly regulated processes with thorough oversight from private and government entities. Allograft is widely available in the United States and allograft procurement is a large industry with varying procurement, sterilization, processing, and distribution procedures. It is important to understand allograft regulation and processing which may affect graft mechanical properties and biological graft integration.
English-language literature, United States government and regulatory agency statues pertaining to allograft procurement, distribution, and usage were reviewed and the findings summarized.
During the processing of allograft, multiple factors including sterilization procedures, irradiation, storage conditions, and graft type all affect the biomechanical properties of the allograft tissue. Biological incorporation and ligamentization of allograft does occur, but at a slower rate compared with autograft. For ligamentous reconstruction around the knee, allograft offers shorter operative time, no donor-site morbidity, but has shown an increased risk for graft failure compared to autograft.
This article reviews the regulations on graft tissue within the United States, factors affecting the biomechanics of allograft tissue, differences in allograft tissue choices, and the use of allograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and multiligamentous knee injury reconstruction.
