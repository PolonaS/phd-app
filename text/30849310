Tendinopathy is a common and disabling condition that is difficult to treat. The pathomolecular events behind tendinopathy remain uncertain. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and may play a role in tendinopathy development. Tenocytes were obtained from human patellar tendons in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Micro-RNA mimics and antagomirs for miR-30d, 26a, and 29a were separately transfected into tenocyte culture. Gene expression for scleraxis, collagen 1 alpha 1 (COL1A1), collagen 3 alpha 1 (COL3A1), interleukin-1-beta (IL-1Î²), interleukin-6 (IL-6), bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2), bone morphogenic protein 12 (BMP12), and osteocalcin was determined for each miRNA mimic and antagomir transfection using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). The results showed that exogenous miR-29a downregulated BMP2 and BMP12, while miR-26a and miR-30d did not have a significant effect on tenocyte gene expression. These findings suggest miR-29a contributes to tendon homeostasis and can serve as a potential therapeutic target in treating tendinopathy.
