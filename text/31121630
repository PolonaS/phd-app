Acute traumatic patellar dislocation is a common injury, and spontaneous reduction may occur at the time of injury or may be reduced at the field of the accident by someone. It may be associated with osteochondral fractures and rupture of medial patellar stabilizers leading to recurrent patellar instability. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the outcomes of medial patellofemoral (PF) ligament (MPFL) reconstruction in recurrent traumatic patellar dislocation. Forty-five patients presented with PF instability as a result of traumatic rupture MPFL with normal patellar tracking underwent MPFL reconstruction without patellar fixation hardware through two parallel transpatellar tunnels and one screw in femoral tunnel. All patients were evaluated clinically preoperatively and at a minimum follow-up of 24 months, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Kujala scores were used to assess the clinical results. All patients were available for evaluation at a minimum of 24 months (up to 36 months). The mean age of these patients at the time of surgery was 22.82 years (range: 18-34 years). All patients gave history of trauma of their knees. Mean IKDC scale showed significant improvement as it rose from 47.17 preoperatively to 77.94 postoperatively, and mean Kujala score rose from 53.88 preoperatively to 86.24 postoperatively (
