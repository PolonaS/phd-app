Female recreational runners are 2-3 times more likely to suffer from knee injury compared with male runners. However, the exact reason for this gender difference regarding knee injury remains unclear. Our study aimed to investigate gender differences in coordination variability between shank and rearfoot during running using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Eleven healthy males and eleven healthy females ran on a treadmill. A modified vector coding technique procedure was used to create joint coupling between shank internal/external rotation and rearfoot eversion/inversion. The standard deviation of each coupling was computed as a measure of coordination variability during the stance phase. All trajectory data of coordination variability between genders were analyzed using a two-sample t-test of SPM. No differences in the normalized spatiotemporal parameters of speed, cadence and step length were found between males and females. SPM showed no significant differences between the genders in coordination variability. This study demonstrated that coordination variability between the shank and rearfoot during running may not be associated with the different incidence rates of knee injuries among male and female participants.
