Falls and injuries related to falls in older adults are a significant health care issue that affects the elderly population. Research suggests that exercise interventions can be effective in improving falls risk factors.
Are there differences in falls risk reduction between two exercise interventions (The Lebed Method - TLM and Stay Active and Independent for Life - SAIL) for community-dwelling older adults?
A quasi-experimental pre- and post-test design was used for this study. One hundred and sixty-three older individuals aged between 60-79 years of age participated in the study. Assessments of falls risk (using the physiological profile assessment), simple reaction time, bilateral knee extension strength, proprioception, balance, visual acuity, and mobility (using timed-up-and-go, TUG) were performed. Analysis of covariance was conducted to compare the differences between the two interventions. Pre-intervention assessments were used as the covariate.
SAIL participants' falls risk were reduced more than TLM. Reaction and TUG times were faster for SAIL participants. However, those individuals who participated in TLM had greater knee extension strength for both legs compared to SAIL participants.
Overall, both interventions were effective in reducing falls risk for older adults. The greater number of improved falls risk factors attained with the SAIL program suggests that multifactorial interventions may be more effective at reducing falls risk. However, since TLM also showed better improved strength, both dance-based and multifactorial interventions can be effective at reducing falls risk factors for older adults.
