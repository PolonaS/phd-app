In this paper, we present a pilot study evaluating novel methods for assessing joint health in patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) using wearable acoustical emission measurements from the knees. Measurements were taken from four control subjects with no known knee injuries, and from four subjects with JIA, before and after treatment. Time and frequency domain features were extracted from the acoustical emission signals and used to compute a knee audio score. The score was used to separate out the two groups of subjects based solely on the sounds their joints produce. It was created using a soft classifier based on gradient boosting trees. The knee audio scores ranged from 0-1 with 0 being a healthy knee and 1 being an involved joint with arthritis. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV) was used to validate the algorithm. The average of the right and left knee audio scores was 0.085±0.099 and 0.89±0.012 for the control group and group with JIA, respectively (p<0.05). The average knee audio score for the subjects with JIA decreased from 0.89±0.012 to 0.25±0.20 following successful treatment (p<0.05). The knee audio score metric successfully distinguished between the control subjects and subjects with JIA. The scores calculated before and after treatment accurately reflected the observed clinical course of the subjects with JIA. After successful treatment, the subjects with JIA were classified as healthy by the algorithm. Knee acoustical emissions provide a novel and cost-effective method for monitoring JIA, and can be used as an objective guide for assessing treatment efficacy.
