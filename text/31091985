In order to determine the validity of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health brief Core Set for Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (ICF-OPD) for the assessment of functioning and environmental factors in Chinese chronic OPD (COPD) patients, we conducted a cross-sectional study with a convenience sample of 100 COPD patients. Data were collected using common questionnaires for COPD patients (Modified British Medical Research Council Questionnaire, COPD Assessment Test, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)), the Brief ICF Core Set for OPD, and the comprehensive ICF checklist. All except one category of the Brief ICF-OPD Core Set were confirmed in our evaluation of its content validity, but there is a high prevalence of problems in 8 categories that were not considered in the Brief ICF-OPD Core Set. The functioning-related components of the Brief ICF-OPD Core Set largely performed similarly to SGRQ in terms of differentiating between patients with different disease severity. Moreover, high correlations between the Brief ICF-OPD Core Set overall score and component scores with the respective SGRQ scales and moderate correlations between ICF-OPD Core Set overall score and component scores and lung function parameters. This study largely confirmed content, known group, and convergent validity of the ICF-OPD.
