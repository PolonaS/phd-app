Objective To define the critical elements of common procedures in arthroscopic surgery. Methods A survey was administered to surgeons associated with the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) to determine the critical elements for four common arthroscopic procedures: anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, knee arthroscopy with meniscal debridement or repair, rotator cuff repair (RCR), and capsulorrhaphy for anterior glenohumeral instability (Bankart repair). Respondents were asked which steps necessitated their direct supervision. The level of experience and practice demographics were also recorded. Results For all applicable procedures, patient positioning and closure were not considered critical steps. Establishing arthroscopic portals was critical for all procedures, except knee arthroscopy. Diagnostic arthroscopy was only critical in ACL reconstruction. Private practice surgeons considered every step of these common procedures to be critical elements. Less experienced surgeons were more likely to regard certain aspects of a procedure critical. Surgeons with >15 years of experience considered diagnostic arthroscopy critical to all procedures, whereas those with <15 years of experience did not. Unlike surgeons with a resident as first assist, surgeons with a physician assistant (PA) or nurse practitioner (NP) found every step of each procedure to be critical except closure and positioning. Conclusion Across all procedures, only patient positioning and closure were consistently regarded as non-critical elements. There were significant differences in responses according to experience and practice setting. Future research is necessary to determine the implications of these findings and guide the definition of the "critical portions" of surgery.
