Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a potentially life-threatening fungal infection usually seen in immunocompromised patients. Pneumocystis jirovecii can be easily detected from oral rinse samples in HIV patients with suspected PCP. In this study, a quantitative real-time PCR assay was used to establish the frequency of detection of P. jirovecii in oral rinses from HIV patients without respiratory symptoms or suspicion of PCP. Two saline oral rinses were collected from 100 ambulant HIV patients and from 60 COPD patients (comparator group). Four HIV patients were positive for P. jirovecii. In three patients, the first sample was positive and in one the second one was positive. One of these patients was on PCP prophylaxis and had a CD4
