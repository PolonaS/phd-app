A 33-year-old male victim of a motor vehicle accident, who presented with a T12 (thoracic 12 vertebra) burst fracture (ISNCSCI T11 AIS-A: International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury T11 ASIA Impairment Scale), was admitted to aÂ rehabilitation hospital. A stage-II left ischial pressure ulcer was also reported. An X-ray of the pelvis revealed bilateral neurogenic heterotopic ossification (NHO) in both hips and knees, which was further confirmed by TC-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scintigraphy. Interventions included indomethacin and conservative management. Surgery was not preferred, as NHO was still immature. Moreover, patient transfer and lower body dressing were unaffected by NHO. It is important to consider an early radiological screen in selected high-risk cases for NHO, to minimize the risk of associated complications.
