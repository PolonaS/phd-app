This study examined the effect of a spring-loaded cane stiffness reduction on upper and lower extremity ground reaction forces in time and frequency domain during cane-aided walking. Twenty-nine participants walked five times over two force plates with a spring-loaded cane set at four different stiffnesses and T-scope knee brace set at 30Â° of knee flexion to simulate a foot injury. Time-frequency domain analyses revealed an increase in ground reaction forces at the simulated injured foot and a decrease in ground reaction forces at the hand via the shaft of the cane for each spring loaded-cane stiffness reduction during walking. The results build on existing literature and highlight the use of spring-loaded canes, braking and propulsive ground reaction force measures, and frequency domain analysis to more accurately assess and monitor the rehabilitation and prevention of upper and lower extremity injuries during cane-aided walking.
