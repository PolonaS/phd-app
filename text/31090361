To summarize the clinical application and research status of open wedge high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO).
Relevant literature at home and abroad was reviewed, and the clinical application, effectiveness and complications, technical comparison, and surgical skills of OWHTO were summarized and analyzed.
OWHTO is an effective treatment for mild to moderate medial compartment osteoarthritis due to knee varus. This method can delay the injury process of medial compartment of the knee, delay the time of total knee arthroplasty, and even avoid joint replacement surgery by adjusting the axial alignment of the lower extremity to the non-pathological lateral compartment through osteotomy and orthopedic. OWHTO has the advantages of small incision, dynamic adjustment of the axial alignment of the lower extremity, accurate correction of malformation, and rapid postoperative recovery.
With the development of surgical instruments and techniques, OWHTO once again enter the sight of orthopedic surgeons. This technique can solve the pain symptoms of arthritis, correct the tibial varus deformity and reconstruct the axial alignment of the lower extremity, and satisfactory clinical results has been obtained.
总结开放楔形胫骨高位截骨术（open wedge high tibial osteotomy，OWHTO）的临床应用及研究现状。.
查阅国内外相关文献，从 OWHTO 临床应用、疗效与并发症、技术对比及手术技巧等方面进行总结分析。.
OWHTO 是治疗由于膝关节内翻导致的轻中度内侧间室骨关节炎的有效方法。该方法通过截骨矫形将下肢力线调整至无病变的外侧间室，延缓膝关节内侧间室的损伤进程，推迟甚至避免行人工全膝关节置换术。OWHTO 具有手术切口小、动态调整下肢力线、精确矫正畸形、术后康复迅速的优势。.
随着手术器械及手术技术的发展，OWHTO 再次广泛用于临床。OWHTO 技术可解决骨关节炎的疼痛症状，矫正胫骨内翻畸形并重建下肢力线，取得了满意的临床效果。.
