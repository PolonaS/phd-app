To improve the accuracy of calibration of C-arm, and overcome the space limitation in surgery, we proposed a new calibrator for online calibration of C-arm. After the image rectification by a polynomial fitting-based global correction method, the C-arm was assumed as an ideal pinhole model. The relationships between two kinds of spatial calibration errors and the distribution of fiducial points were studied: the performance of FRE (Fiducial Registration Error) and TRE (Target Registration Error) were not consistent, but both were best at the 12 marked points; the TRE decreased with the increase of the uniformity of calibration points distribution, and with the decrease of the distance between the target point and the center of calibration points. A calibrator with 12 fiducial points conical helically distributed, which could be placed on the knee, was an attractive option. A total of 10 experiments on C-arm calibration accuracy were conducted and the mean value of mapping error was 0.41 mm. We designed an ACL reconstruction navigation system and carried out specimen experiments on 4 pairs of dry femur and tibia. The mean accuracy of navigation system was 0.85 mm, which is important to the tunnel positioning for ACL reconstruction.
