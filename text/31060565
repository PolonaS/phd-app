Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality. The most important pathophysiological change of COPD is airway obstruction. Airway obstruction can cause airflow restriction and obstructive ventilation dysfunction. Currently, many studies have shown that there is EMT phenomenon in the process of airway remodeling of COPD. Cullin4A (CUL4A) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with other factors to form the E3 complex. Studies have shown that CLU4A is associated with EMT in non-small cell lung cancer and other cancers. However, its relationship with EMT in COPD has not been reported systematically. In this study, we detected the expression of CUL4A in lung epithelium of COPD patients. In addition, the regulatory effect and mechanism of CUL4A on EMT in COPD were clarified in small airway epithelial cells.
The expression of CUL4A was assessed by immunohistochemistry in lung epithelium specimens from smokers, non-smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The role of CUL4A on cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human small airway epithelial cells (HSAEpiCs) was assessed by silencing or overexpression CUL4A in vitro. Cigarette smoke is recognized as a high-risk factor in the induction of COPD, and its damage to the airway involves airway damage, airway inflammation and airway remodeling.
The results shown that CUL4A expression in small airway epithelium was significantly increased in patients with COPD. We also observed a significant negative association between CUL4A and FEV
Our results showed that CUL4A was overexpressed in lung epithelium of COPD patients, and CUL4A could regulate EMT of human small airway epithelium, which revealed a new mechanism of remodeling of small airway epithelium of COPD patients.
