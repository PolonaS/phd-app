To describe the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic fixation of displaced posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) avulsion fractures with/without associated tibia plateau fractures using an adjustable loop suspensory fixation device.
Four male patients who have sustained PCL tibia avulsion fractures with/without associated tibia plateau fractures were operated on in a single centre using an arthroscopic adjustable loop suspensory device technique. After arthroscopic evaluation and reduction of the fracture using a probe and PCL drill guide, a proximal medial tibial mini incision was used to drill a bone tunnel through the fracture fragment. An adjustable loop suspensory device was relayed through the bone tunnel via a transtibial manner, and the button device was flipped onto the bony fragment for fixation. The associated tibial plateau fractures were then fixed if present. Knee function at the last follow-up was evaluated by International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee Injury And Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm scores. Range of motion and knee stability were assessed, and fracture union was evaluated by plain radiographs.
All patients underwent the operation successfully with no major complications encountered. All were followed up for a minimum of 6 months. There was no instability reported by the patients or found during objective evaluation using posterior drawer test and reverse pivot shift test. All fractures achieved union. Mean post-operative Lysholm score was 91.5 (range 85-95), IKDC score was 85.1 (range 74.7-89.7) and KOOS was 89.3 (range 81.5-94.6). All patients returned to their pre-injury activities of daily living and work. Radiographic evaluation showed union at the fracture site in all four patients at the last follow-up.
This arthroscopic procedure is a viable minimally invasive technique that is appropriate in minimally displaced avulsion fractures of the PCL with associated tibia plateau fractures.
