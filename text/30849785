RAMP lesion, defined as peripheral detachment lesion of posterior horn of medial meniscus, has been shown to accompany anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures and is thought to play an important role in the knee joint stability. In this study, we aimed to present results of postoperative knee function scores and patient satisfaction after surgical repair of RAMP lesion. We included 15 patients who had undergone knee arthroscopy due to RAMP lesion in 2017. We recorded demographic data, diagnosis, pre- and postoperative International Knee Documentation Committee and Tegner-Lysholm scores of all patients. In this study, they included 15 patients: the number of male and female patients was eight and seven, respectively. The mean age of patients was 26.8 (18-35). Associated injuries included ACL rupture in 12 patients, additional medial meniscus lesion in 3 patients, lateral meniscus lesion in 3 patients, and superomedial patellar plicae syndrome in 2 patients. All patients had the same postoperative rehabilitation protocol. Mean preoperative Tegner-Lysholm knee score was 64.4 (53-75), while it was 82.5 (75-89) postoperatively, and mean preoperative and postoperative Visual Analogue Scale score at last postoperative follow-up were 5.26 (2-8) and 1.06 (0-2), respectively. All differences were found to be statistically significant. Meniscal RAMP lesions are commonly associated with ACL ruptures. RAMP repair significantly increases postoperative knee function scores and patient satisfaction following ACL reconstruction.
