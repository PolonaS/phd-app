The implementation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) guidelines in the real-world setting remains low. Pulmonologists should participate in the new paradigms of chronicity of COPD, by providing their knowledge, expertise, innovation and research. The objective of this study was to survey pulmonologists on the adherence to COPD guidelines and to measure the change of attitude after holding meetings presenting the latest research on the subject.
Fifty questions on COPD management were sent to 150 pulmonologists. Using the AUDIT methodology, the responses were discussed at several face-to-face meetings, held in different autonomous communities of Spain. The same questionnaire was subsequently sent to the participants and changes in their responses were analysed.
In total, 148 physicians (60.1% female) completed study. The main responses were: (1) 16.2% diagnose following clinical criteria; (2) 78.4% performed diagnostic tests other than spirometry; (3) 73.6% always determined alpha-1 antitrypsin levels (81.8% in the second questionnaire, p < 0.05); (4) 73% determined the patient's phenotype; (5) 42% always asked about passive exposure to cigarette smoke (55% after the meetings, p < 0.05); (6) 58.1% always asked about exposure to other pollutants or biomass; (7) 29.1% always assessed inhalational technique; (8) dual bronchodilators were the most common treatment (49.3%) used for patients with frequent exacerbator phenotype, glycopyrronium + indacaterol being the preferred option (44.1%); (9) 41.2% discontinued inhaled corticosteroids treatment (54.7% in the second questionnaire, p < 0.05); (10) for exacerbation admissions, 52% replaced maintenance bronchodilators with short-acting agents and introduced early background treatment (58.8% in the second round, p < 0.05). Few variations occurred in the participants' answers after the meetings.
The adherence of pulmonologists to clinical practice recommendations for COPD management is suboptimal. As well as face-to-face meetings, more intensive interventions are required to raise awareness on the importance of improving compliance with clinical guidelines.
