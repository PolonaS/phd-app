A calcium phosphate (CaP)-hybridized tendon graft improves tendon-to-bone healing. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the progression of morphological changes in the femoral and tibial bone tunnels after anatomic single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the CaP-hybridized tendon graft versus an untreated tendon graft during 2 years of follow-up.
We hypothesized that the CaP-hybridized tendon graft would prevent the progression of bone tunnel enlargement compared with the untreated tendon graft.
The CaP group comprised 19 patients, while the conventional group comprised 18. Computed tomography was performed at postoperative 1 week, 1 year, and 2 years. The bone tunnel enlargement and tunnel translation at the aperture of the femoral and tibial tunnels were analyzed.
In the CaP group, the femoral bone tunnel did not expand during 2 years of follow-up. In the conventional group, the femoral bone tunnel diameters at postoperative 1 year and 2 years were enlarged compared with postoperative 1 week, and the proximal and distal walls of the femoral bone tunnel shifted proximally and distally, respectively. The femoral bone tunnel in the CaP group was smaller than that in the conventional group at 1 year postoperatively. Although the tibial bone tunnels expanded for up to 1 year postoperatively in both groups, the expanded bone tunnel reduced during 2 years of follow-up only in the CaP group.
In anatomic single-bundle ACL reconstruction, the femoral bone tunnel in the CaP group did not expand or progress with time compared with the conventional group, while the tibial bone tunnel in the CaP group expanded for up to 1 year postoperatively and then reduced for up to 2 years postoperatively. The CaP-hybridized tendon can prevent the progression of bone tunnel enlargement.
