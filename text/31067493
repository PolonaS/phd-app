Recent observational studies assessed the association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and lung function in adults, but the magnitude of this association remains uncertain. We estimated the magnitude of the association between NAFLD and lung function on spirometry (predicted forced expiratory volume in 1â€‰s [FEV
We searched publication databases using predefined keywords to identify studies (published up to October 4, 2018), in which NAFLD was diagnosed by imaging or biochemistry (no studies with biopsy-proven NAFLD were available). Data from selected studies were extracted, and meta-analysis was performed using random-effects modelling.
Six observational studies (5 cross-sectional and 1 longitudinal) with aggregate data on 133,707 individuals (27.8% with NAFLD) of predominantly Asian ethnicity (74.6%) were included in the final analysis. There were significant differences in predicted FEV
NAFLD is associated with significant reductions of both FEV
