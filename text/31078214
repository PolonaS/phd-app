Dyspnea, the most common symptom in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), often becomes disabling in advanced stages of the disease. Chronic dyspnea erodes perceived health status and diminishes engagement in physical activity, often leading to skeletal muscle deconditioning, anxiety, depression, and social isolation. Broader understanding of the pathophysiologic underpinnings of dyspnea has allowed us to formulate a sound rationale for individualized management. This review examines recent research and provides historical context. The overarching objectives are to consider current constructs of the physiologic mechanisms of activity-related dyspnea and identify specific targets amenable to therapeutic manipulation in patients with COPD.
