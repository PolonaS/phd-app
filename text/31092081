In Denmark, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the most common comorbidity in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of COPD and other common comorbidities on NSCLC mortality.
Patients (n = 534) diagnosed with NSCLC at Aalborg University Hospital from 2008-2010 were included retrospectively in this study. Patient records were assessed and the population was dichotomized in COPD and non-COPD subgroups. Comorbidities i.e., ischemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, apoplexia, former malignancy, interstitial lung disease and psychiatric comorbidity were registered and a comorbidity count were calculated. Survival was assessed with log-rank test and uni- and multivariate regression analysis were performed for COPD-status and comorbidity count adjusting for age, gender, BMI, smoking exposure, cancer stage, method of treatment and eastern cooperative cancer group (ECOG) performance status score.
Of 534 NSCLC patients included, 470 were divided into COPD and non-COPD subgroups, 70% with COPD (329/470) and 30% without COPD (141/470). Only 32.5% of the patients in the COPD-group had previously diagnosed COPD. Log-rank test did not show statistically significant difference in survival between the COPD and non-COPD groups (p = .215). Multivariate Cox regression analysis did not show statistically significant association between overall 5-year mortality and the presence of COPD (HR-adj = 0.808, 95% CI = 0.612; 1.068) or other comorbidities (HR-adj = 1.101, 95% CI = 0.979; 1.237) when adjusted for age, BMI, gender, smoking exposure, ECOG performance status, treatment and TNM-stage.
Our findings do not suggest that COPD nor other common comorbidities are significantly associated with higher mortality in NSCLC patients.
