The rectus femoris (RF) has a region-specific functional role; that is, the proximal region of the RF contributes more than the middle and distal regions during hip flexion. This study aimed to investigate whether RF strain injury affected the region-specific functional role of the muscle. We studied seven soccer players with a history of unilateral RF strain injury. Injury data were obtained from a questionnaire survey and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Multichannel surface electromyographic (SEMG) signals were recorded from the proximal to distal regions of the RF with 24 electrodes during isometric knee extension and hip flexion. The SEMG signals of each channel during hip flexion were normalised by those during knee extension for the injured and non-injured RF (HF/KE), and compared among the proximal, middle, and distal regions. Six RF strain injuries showed a low signal area in MRI. There was no significant difference in muscle strength between the injured and non-injured RF. While the HF/KE in the proximal region was significantly higher than those in the middle and distal regions in the non-injured RF, a difference in the HF/KE was seen only between the proximal and distal regions of the injured RF. Furthermore, the HF/KE of the most proximal channel in the injured RF was significantly lower than that in the non-injured RF. However, there was no significant difference between injured and non-injured areas in the HF/KE. Our findings suggest that the region-specific functional role of the RF muscle is partly affected by RF strain injury.
