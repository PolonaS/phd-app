Great interest remains in the structures of the knee anterolateral complex and how they work synergistically with the anterior cruciate ligament to control anterolateral rotatory laxity. Many studies have now used magnetic resonance imaging to assess the degree of damage to the anterolateral ligament. The systematic review described in this commentary rigorously highlights the many deficiencies that exist within our current understanding of the imaging analysis of these structures. Marked variability in the definition of anterolateral ligament injury, significant methodological differences, and the lack of a gold standard reference make it very challenging to translate the findings of these imaging studies into clinical practice. More information is required to fully understand the injury pattern, and then clinical studies are needed to guide treatment. Hopefully we will then have the ability to better treat our patients with these challenging complex laxity patterns that exist over and above an isolated anterior cruciate ligament injury.
