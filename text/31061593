Bilateral ACL rupture is a relatively uncommon injury with an incidence of 2-4%. Most bilateral ACL rupture occurs at two different times, but few cases of single-staged bilateral ACL ruptures have also been reported. There have been reports of both single-staged, and two-staged reconstruction of bilateral ACL ruptures in the literature but without a clear consensus. We present a series of five bilateral ACL rupture cases managed by single-staged arthroscopic ACL reconstruction, using quadrupled hamstring grafts. All of them were young males, with an average age of 26.8 years (Range: 19-39 years). Three out of five of these cases (60%) had sustained the injury to both the knees simultaneously while playing sports. All the five patients had generalized joint laxity with significant hyperextension of their knees. All the ten knees (in five patients) were clinically stable, at their last follow-ups. None of the knees had any early or late complications. A single-staged bilateral ACL reconstruction is a safe, reproducible, and cost-effective procedure for patients with a bilateral ACL deficient knee, in experienced hands.
