Despite their proven effect, the rates of vaccinations are low. The aim of this study was to determine the rates and associated factors of influenza and pneumonia vaccinations in patients who were hospitalized because of acute respiratory failure. Patients hospitalized because of acute hypoxemic or hypercapnic respiratory failure were recruited for this retrospective study. A survey was conducted with 97 patients. Primary diagnoses, ages, reasons of hospitalizations, education status, vaccination rates, information resources, and thoughts about vaccinations were recorded.
Forty-five (46%) of the patients were female, and 52 (54%) were male. The mean age was 67Â±12 years. The primary diagnoses were lung disorders (n=77, 79%), cardiac disorders (n=16, 17%), and neuromuscular disorders (n=5, 4%). Seventy-two (74%) patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with primary lung disorders. All patients were hospitalized due to acute respiratory failure. The main reason for acute respiratory failure was infection in 40 patients (42%). The overall influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates were 26% and 15%, respectively; for patients with COPD it was 30% and 17%, respectively. The main providers of information were doctors (42%). Vaccination status was not associated with infections or other reasons of hospitalization, age, sex, educational status, and number of hospital admissions in the previous year. Fifty-one patients (52%) had no belief in the benefits of vaccinations.
Vaccination rates were found to be low in patients who were frequently hospitalized. Vaccination status was not related with hospitalization due to infections and history of hospitalization; awareness of vaccinations should be improved both in doctors and patients.
