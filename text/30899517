Self-efficacy is related to outcome after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. The Knee Self Efficacy Scale (K-SES) available in Swedish and English, was developed to measure self-efficacy in present (K-SES

Exploratory factor analysis distinguished two underlying important factors: K-SES
Acceptability, internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the K-SES-D subscales are satisfactory. Construct validity of both subscales was confirmed by exploratoryÂ factor analysis and hypothesis testing. However, construct validity was not confirmed in CFA. Further research is needed to test responsiveness.
