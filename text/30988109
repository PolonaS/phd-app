A long track speed skater sustained a deep horizontal cut to the right knee just distally to the patella, after he got hit by the skate blade of the pair mate. The injury included a complete patellar tendon rupture from the apex of the patella, a 1 mm deep transverse cut in the femoral condyle and a partial rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. The tendon rupture was repaired with transosseous suture repair without augmentation. A knee brace was used for 8 weeks, with a gradual decrease in flexion restraints. A rehabilitation programme was overseen by a dedicated physiotherapist. At 6 months, he started a gradual return to skating sessions. After 1 year, he had symmetrical single-legged hop performance, but quadriceps weakness due to pain. The patient returned to competition speed skating at national levels after 11 months, and within the first postoperative year, he was breaking new personal records on the ice.
