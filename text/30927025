Overuse shoulder injuries are common in youth handball, but research is limited. The purpose of this study was to identify pre-season risk factors associated with overuse shoulder injuries in this population.
One-hundred and thirty-eight (70 boys and 68 girls) youth elite players (age 14.1 ± 0.8 years, height 175.2 ± 8.2 cm, weight 64.0 ± 9.6 kg) completed a pre-season screening protocol. Passive glenohumeral range of motion and maximum external (ER) and internal rotation (IR) strength were measured with a manual goniometer and a hand-held dynamometer. Scapular dyskinesia and maximum throwing velocity were also assessed. Players completed standardised questionnaires over the 2017-2018 season and reported any overuse shoulder symptoms.
