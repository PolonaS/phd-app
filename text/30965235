We aimed to determine whether bone remodeling and vessel formation in the osteochondral unit are suppressed by supplementing with docosahexaenoic acid in anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT)-induced rats.
Twelve-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats were randomized to sham-operated, ACLT-operated and treated with vehicle, or ACLT-operated and treated with DHA groups. Micro-architecture and vasculature in the tibial osteochondral unit were examined by micro-CT, as well as by histomorphometry. To evaluate the effects of DHA in vitro, we conducted functional and expressional assays in RAW264.7 cells and HUVECs. Finally, we used OARSI-modified Mankin criteria and histological analyses to assess the status of the cartilage layer.
Microstructural parameters in the osteochondral unit showed that bone mass loss and angiogenesis were less in DHA-treated rats than in vehicle-treated rats. Immunofluorescence-positive cells labeled with TRAP, RANKL, CD31, and endomucin agents in the osteochondral unit of ACLT-operated rats were reduced in the DHA-treated group compared with the vehicle-treated group. Furthermore, the number of TRAP-stained cells, areas of bone resorption pits, and mRNA expression of TRAP, CTSK, MITF, and NFATC1 were reduced in RAW264.7 cells treated with RANKL + DHA compared with those treated with only RANKL. Tube formation, proliferation and migration of HUVECs, and VEGF-C mRNA and VEGFR2 protein expression were inhibited by DHA. The decrease in OARSI score, and MMP-13 and collagen X expression suggested that DHA attenuated cartilage degeneration.
DHA has the ability to restrain bone remodeling and vessel formation in the osteochondral unit, which may contribute to protection of cartilage.
