To collect information about the needs of families affected by childhood-onset dystrophinopathies residing in the United States.
Individuals with an eligible dystrophinopathy were identified by the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking, and Research network. Between September 2008 and December 2012, 272 caregivers completed a 48-item survey about needs related to information, healthcare services, psychosocial issues, finances, caregiver demographics, and the individual's functioning.
Overall, at least 80% of the survey items were identified as needs for more than one-half of caregivers. Among the needs identified, physical health and access to information were currently managed for most caregivers. Items identified as needed but managed less consistently were funding for needs not covered by insurance and psychosocial support.
Healthcare providers, public health practitioners, and policymakers should be aware of the many needs reported by caregivers, and focus on addressing gaps in provision of needed financial and psychosocial services.
