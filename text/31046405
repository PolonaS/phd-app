Azithromycin prevents acute exacerbations in COPD (AECOPD); however, its value in the treatment of AECOPD requiring hospitalization is yet to be defined.
We investigated whether a 3-month intervention with low-dose azithromycin could decrease treatment failure (TF) when initiated at hospital admission and added to standard care.
In an investigator-initiated, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients hospitalized for an AECOPD, with a smoking history of ≥10 pack-years and ≥1 exacerbation in the previous year, were randomized (1:1) within 48-hours of admission to azithromycin or placebo. The study drug (500mg/day for 3days) was administered on top of a standardized acute treatment of systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics, and subsequently continued for 3 months (3m) (250mg/2days). Patients were followed-up for 6m thereafter. Time-to-first event analyses evaluated the TF rate within 3m as a novel primary endpoint in the intention-to-treat population, with TF defined as the composite of treatment intensification with medication (TI), step-up in hospital care or readmission for respiratory reasons (SH) or all-cause mortality.
301 patients were randomized to azithromycin (n=147) or placebo (n=154). The TF rate within 3m was 49% in the azithromycin and 60% in the placebo group (HR=0.73; 95%CI 0.53-1.01; p=0.0526). TI, SH and mortality rates within 3m were 47% vs 60% (p=0.0272), 13% vs 28% (p=0.0024) and 2% vs 4% (p=0.5075), respectively. Clinical benefits were lost 6m after withdrawal.
3m of azithromycin for AECOPD requiring hospitalization may significantly reduce TF during the highest risk period. Prolonged treatment seems needed to maintain clinical benefits. Clinical trial registration available at www.clinicaltrials.gov, ID NCT02135354.
