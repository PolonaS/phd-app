The aim of the study. To estimate the effectiveness of clinical patients register implementation as well as to analyze different treatment and prophylactic programs on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients' structure.
The COPD patient's register consists of 4257 cases. Spirometrical data were evaluated. Dynamic follow was performed on 567 COPD patients. Bronchodilator's therapy was estimated as well as combined inhaled corticosteroid/ long acting β2-agonist medications and vaccination against pneumococcal infection.
Computer program "Electronic polyclinic" proposed by the authors of this article is effective in precision of diagnostic decision making in cohort study, dynamic follow up after clinical symptoms, evaluation of instrumental and laboratory results, prophylactics and treatment effectiveness, "clinical patients registers" automatic formation using syndrome or nosological principle, checking the COPD patients in the group of those with bronchial obstruction.
Positive effects of long-acting bronchodilator treatment on COPD exacerbation decreasing and more expressed effect of inhaled corticosteroid/ long acting β2-agonists were confirmed. More interesting result was influence of vaccination against pneumococcal infection PCV13 (polyvalent conjugated vaccine) on exacerbation frequency and dyspnea severity.
