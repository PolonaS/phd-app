Prolonged static postures (PSPs) may predispose dentists to develop cervical herniated intervertebral disc (C-HIVD); however, there is limited evidence supporting this in the literature thus far. We conducted this study to fit the data gap.
We conducted a retrospective nationwide population-based study using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to identify 10,930 dentists, an identical number of age- and sex-matched participants from the general population, and 73,718 other health care providers (HCPs, non-dentists). Comparisons for the risk of developing C-HIVD between dentists and the general population, and between dentists and other HCPs were performed by tracing their medical histories between 2007 and 2011.
Dentists had a cumulative incidence rate of 1.1% for C-HIVD during the 5-year follow-up period. Overall, there was no difference of the risk for C-HIVD between dentists and the general population after adjusting for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, liver disease, mental disorders, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, stroke, and renal disease (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9-1.6). However, stratified analysis showed that younger dentists (≤ 34 years) had a trend of higher risk for C-HIVD than members of the younger general population (AOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 0.9-4.1). There was no difference found between dentists and other HCPs (AOR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.8-1.1).
Younger dentists had a trend of higher risk of developing C-HIVD than members of the general population.
