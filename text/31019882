As the anatomy and biomechanics of the posterolateral corner (PLC) of the knee have become better understood, the importance of the PLC's proper function has become a more frequently raised subject. Misdiagnosed chronic posterolateral instability may lead to serious consequences, including cruciate ligament reconstruction graft failure. It has been proved that high-grade PLC injuries need to be treated operatively. Surgical approaches vary, and techniques are still developing. Considering avoidance of an extended surgical approach and minimizing the risk of common peroneal nerve or popliteal artery injuries, we developed the minimally invasive, arthroscopic-assisted, anatomic PLC reconstruction.
