Exercise training is key to the comprehensive management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Interactive game-based systems have been proposed to improve effectiveness and compliance with exercise training.
To evaluate the effectiveness of Wii Fit balance board as an additional tool for exercise training in patients with COPD. As a secondary aim we will evaluate the costs.
In a randomized controlled trial, patients were divided into experimental (EG) and control (CG) groups. The CG performed exercise training on a cycle ergometer three times a week for 6 weeks. The EG also followed a program (yoga, strength training, aerobic exercise) using the Wii Fit system. Pre and post treatment six-minute walking distance (6MWD) test, transitional dyspnea index (TDI), the Medical Research Council (MRC) score the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), the body max index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity index (BODE) were assessed.
The 6MWD increased from 410.7 (105.3) to 477.5 (122.4) and from 376.6 (81.0) to 420 (77.6) meters, in CG and EG respectively, p=0.0001 without any difference between groups. Both groups experienced significant improvements in TDI and SGRQ, but not in MRC and BODE, without any significant difference between groups.
A Wii Fit balance board based video game program was feasible but did not add any benefit to a well conducted standard exercise training program in patients with COPD.
