Epithelial cells that line lung airways produce and secrete proteins with important roles in barrier function and host defense. Secretion of airway goblet cells is controlled by autophagy proteins during inflammatory conditions, resulting in accumulation of mucin proteins. We hypothesized that autophagy proteins would also be important in the function of club cells, a dominant secretory airway epithelial cell that is dysregulated in chronic lung disease. We found that in the absence of an inflammatory stimulus, mice with club cells deficient for the autophagy protein Atg5, had a markedly diminished expression of secreted host defense proteins Scgb1a1, Sftpa1 and Sftpd, as well as abnormal club cell morphology. Adult mice with targeted loss of Atg5 also showed diminished levels of host defense proteins in regenerating cells following ablation with naphthalene. A mouse strain with global deficiency of Atg16l1, an Atg5 binding partner, had a similar loss of host defense proteins and abnormal club cell morphology. Cigarette smoke exposure reduced levels of Scgb1a1 in WT mice as expected. Smoke exposure was not required to trigger club cell abnormalities in mice bearing the human ATG16 variant
