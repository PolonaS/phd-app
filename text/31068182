Platelet count is a prognostic indicator in the general population and elderly. Thrombocytosis during acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) has been associated with mortality; however, the relationship between platelet count and mortality in stable COPD is unknown.
We performed post hoc secondary analysis on a subsample of 1797 patients in the Study to Understand Mortality and Morbidity in COPD (SUMMIT) who had blood samples drawn at baseline. Participants were current or former smokers, 40-80 years old with moderate COPD and history or increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease. The primary outcome was on and post-treatment all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included first-on-treatment moderate/severe AECOPD and on-treatment CV composite event (CV death, myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina and transient ischemic attack). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate study endpoint associations with platelet count quintile grouping, continuous platelet count utilizing two-term fractional polynomials, and categories of low, normal and high platelet count (< 150, ≥150 to < 300, ≥300 × 10
Patients were followed for 2.3 ± 0.9 years for vital status and 1.6 ± 1.1 years for morbidity endpoints during which 105 (5.8%) died, 651 (36.2%) experienced AECOPD (159 with severe AECOPD) and 86 (4.8%) experienced a CV event. A U-shaped association between platelet count and all-cause mortality was observed. Compared to the third quintile group (Q3) of platelet count, risk of death was increased in the lowest quintile group (Q1; hazard ratio [HR]: 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93-3.23) and highest quintile group (Q5; HR: 1.66; 95%CI: 0.89-3.10), though point estimates were imprecise. Using clinical cutoffs, compared with normal platelet counts (≥150 to < 300 × 10
In stable COPD platelet count demonstrated a U-shaped association with increased risk of 3-year all-cause mortality, though a platelet count level above or below which risk of mortality was increased could not be definitively identified.
