Resistance training exercise prescription is often based on exercises performed at a percentage of a 1 repetition maximum (1 RM). Following knee injury, there is no consensus when a patient can safely perform 1 RM testing. Resistance training programs require the use of higher loads and loads used in knee injury rehabilitation may be too low to elicit gains in strength and power. A maximum isometric contraction can safely be performed during early stages of knee rehabilitation and has potential to predict an isotonic knee extension 1 RM.
To determine whether a 1 repetition maximum (1 RM) on an isotonic knee extension machine can be predicted from isometric peak torque measurements.
Descriptive laboratory study.
University research laboratory.
12 male and 8 female healthy physically active adults.
An isokinetic dynamometer was used to determine isometric peak torque (Nm). 1 RM testing was performed on a knee extension machine. Linear regression was used to develop a prediction equation and Bland-Altman Plots with Limits of Agreement calculations were used to validate the equation.
There was a significant correlation (P<.001, r=.926) between peak torque (283.0±22.6 Nm) and the knee extension 1 RM (69.1±22.6 kg). The prediction equation overestimated loads (2.3±9.1 kg, 95% CI -15.6-20.1).
The results show isometric peak torque values obtained on an isokinetic dynamometer can be used to estimate 1 RM values for isotonic knee extension. Although the prediction equation tends to overestimate loads, the relatively wide confidence intervals indicate results should be viewed with caution.
