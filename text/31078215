"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often accompanied by extrapulmonary manifestations such as limb muscle dysfunction. This term encompasses several features, including atrophy, weakness, and reduced oxidative capacity. Clinicians should become accustomed with this manifestation of COPD because of its relevance for important outcomes such as exercise tolerance and survival. Measuring muscle strength and mass can be performed with simple and valid tools that could be implemented in clinical practice. One identified, limb muscle dysfunction is amenable to therapy such as exercise training that has been repeatedly shown to improve muscle mass, strength, and oxidative capacity in COPD."
