We investigated the injury pattern in rock climbers and their return to sport for operative and nonoperative management. 432 injuries in 237 climbers recorded: 41.9% hand/elbow, 19.9% foot/ankle, 17.3% shoulder. 66% patients required no treatment, 49 (21%) underwent physical therapy, 27 (11%) underwent surgery with 93% satisfaction. Nonoperative patients recovered at 3.9 months; surgical patients took 9.1 months to return to sport (p = 0.01). Return to same level: 79% nonsurgical patients and 70% surgical patients (p = 0.30). Most injuries underwent nonoperative treatment. Operative treatment allowed a similar amount to return to sport at pre-injury level with a longer time course.
