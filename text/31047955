Chronic bronchitis (CB) increases risk of COPD exacerbations. We have shown that the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) CB definition identifies patients with a similar clinical phenotype as classically defined CB. Whether the SGRQ CB definition is a predictor of future COPD exacerbations is unknown.
We analyzed 7,557 smokers with normal spirometry and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage 1-4 COPD in the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD study with longitudinal follow-up data on exacerbations. Subjects were divided into classic CB
There were 1,434 classic CB
The SGRQ CB definition identified more subjects at risk for future exacerbations than the classic CB definition. SGRQ CB was at least a similar if not better predictor of future exacerbations than classic CB.
