Oxygen therapy is used to reverse hypoxemia since more than a century. Current usage is broader and includes routine oxygen administration despite normoxemia which may result in prolonged periods of hyperoxemia. While systematic oxygen therapy was expected to be of benefit in some ischemic diseases such as stroke or acute myocardial infarction, recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have challenged this hypothesis by showing the absence of clinical improvement. Although oxygen is known to be toxic at high inspired oxygen fractions, a recent meta-analysis of RCTs revealed the life-threatening effect of hyperoxemia, with a dose-dependent relationship. Several recommendations have therefore been updated: (i) to monitor peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO
