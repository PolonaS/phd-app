It is not always easy to diagnose pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). The aim of the present study is to make
a differential diagnosis by studying the same markers in patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), patients with benign
lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia), and healthy volunteers to determine the roles of these markers
in pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor diagnosis and to identify their power.
A total of 100 participants including 23 PNET patients and 28 NSCLC patients who were pathologically diagnosed
but not yet treated, 25 participants with benign disease, and 24 healthy volunteers were included in this cross-sectional study.
No significant difference was found between the chromogranin A (CgA) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 (SCCA1)
values among the groups (PNET, NSCLC, benign, healthy volunteers), but the difference in progesterone-releasing peptide (ProGRP),
neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and adjusted NSE was statistically significant (P values were respectively ProGRP, P = 0.006; NSE, P =
0.015; NSE adjusted, P = 0.09). In a comparison of the PNET and NSCLC groups, having a ProGRP value higher than 84.6 pg/mL revealed
PNET with 60.9% sensitivity and 89.3% specificity (P = 0.001).
The ProGRP value is the only indicator that distinguishes the PNET group from the other 3 groups.
