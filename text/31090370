the study of comorbid status and characteristics of clinical course of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
We conducted a retrospective analysis of case histories of 958 IHD patients aged 32 to 93 years (mean age of 60.8±10.2 years), including men - 525 (54.8%), women - 433 (45.2%) who were treated in the cardiology Department of city clinical hospital №5 of Nizhny Novgorod. Related COPD was diagnosed in 251 patients (26.3%). We compared two groups patients: with IHD and COPD, and the second - persons suffering from only IHD (without COPD).
Myocardial infarction was transferred by 62.2% of patients in Group 1, which is 16.3% more than in Group 2 (p&lt;0.05). Arterial hypertension in patients with COPD was 13.6% more frequent than in patients without COPD (p&lt;0.05), and 6.4% more often (p&lt;0.05), with comorbid pathology there was a chronic and paroxysmal forms of atrial fibrillation. In patients with IHD in combination with COPD it is 21.5% more often (p&lt;0.05) than in IHD without COPD, there was shortness of breath and 32.1% more often (p&lt;0.05) of the heartbeat. In patients with IHD with COPD, a higher level of was C-reactive protein detected (p&lt;0.05) and more pronounced violations of the lipid profile (p&lt;0.05).
COPD makes a significant contribution to the development of the cardiovascular continuum, modifying its course. A modern patient with COPD is a high-risk patient with severe cardiovascular comorbidity and various polymorbidity.
