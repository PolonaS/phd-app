Revision ACL surgery may be complicated by tunnel malposition and/or tunnel widening and often requires a staged treatment approach that includes bone grafting, a period of several months to allow bone graft incorporation and then definitive revision ACL reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of a single-staged ACL revision reconstruction technique using a cylindrical dowel bone graft for patients who have existing posteriorly placed and/or widened tibial tunnels in the tibia at a minimum of 2 years follow-up.
Between 2010 and 2014, patients undergoing single-stage revision ACL reconstruction with the described technique were prospectively enrolled and evaluated. At a minimum of 24 months, patients were evaluated by physical examination, multiple clinical outcome instruments including KOOS, Tegner and Lysholm, and preoperative and postoperative MRIs.
At a mean of 35.1 months, 18 consecutive patients had no revision surgery and no subjective knee instability. There were statistically significant improvements in the Tegner (median 2, interquartile range 2.25; p < 0.01), Lysholm (20.0 ± 15.0; p < 0.01), KOOS symptoms scale (12.9 ± 11.8; p < 0.01), KOOS pain scale (15.4 ± 18.7; p < 0.01), KOOS ADL scale (13.5 ± 19.0; p < 0.01), KOOS sports scale (32.8 ± 26.4; p < 0.01), and KOOS QoL scale (18.1 ± 16.9; p < 0.01). Postoperative MRI demonstrated statistically significant anteriorization of the tibial tunnel and a statistically significant decrease in tunnel widening.
Revision ACL reconstruction utilizing a single-staged tibial tunnel grafting technique resulted in improved knee pain, function, and stability at a minimum of 24-month follow-up.
