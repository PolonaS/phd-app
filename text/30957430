To estimate the incidence, prevalence and mortality of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).
An inception cohort of patients with incident APS in 2000-2015 in a geographically well-defined population was identified based on comprehensive individual medical record review. All cases met the 2006 Sydney APS criteria (primary definition) or had APS by physician consensus (secondary definition). Lupus anticoagulant, IgM and IgG aCL and anti-β2 glycoprotein-1 antibodies were tested in a centralized lab. Incidence rates were age- and sex-adjusted to the US white 2010 population. Prevalence estimates were obtained from the incidence rates assuming no increased mortality associated with APS and assuming migration in/out of the area was independent of disease status.
In 2000-2015, 33 cases of incident APS by the Sydney criteria were identified (mean age 54.2 years, 55% female; 97% Caucasian). The annual incidence of APS was 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-2.8) per 100,000 population aged ≥ 18 years. Incidence rates were similar in both sexes. The estimated prevalence of APS was 50 per 100,000 (95% CI: 42-58) and was similar in both sexes. Six (18%) patients had a concurrent diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. The most frequent clinical manifestation was deep venous thrombosis. The overall mortality of patients with APS was not significantly different from the general population (standardized mortality ratio: 1.61; 95% CI: 0.74-3.05).
APS occurred in about 2 persons per 100,000 per year. The estimated prevalence is 50 per 100,000. Overall mortality was not different from the general population. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
