Differences in knee development result in morphological variations observed among individuals. Some of them predispose to significant knee injuries. Although the anatomical risk factors are well established in adults, there is still a need for further research in this area in the group of children. This work aims to determine the morphological variations of the intercondylar notch of the femur predisposing to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in the pediatric population. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the knee were retrospectively analyzed in 74 patients aged 4-18 years. Examinations were performed due to pain complaints after trauma. The completely torn ACL was found in 35 patients. The diagnosis was confirmed intraoperatively. The remaining patients, with no signs of injuries, were qualified as a reference group. The intercondylar notch width was evaluated by calculating the Notch Width Index. Additionally, the morphology of the intercondylar eminence was assessed. Finally, a statistical analysis of the obtained data was performed.Patients with a torn ACL had a narrower intercondylar notch (a lower Notch Width Index, P = 0.0007) as well as a broader and more sharply ended intercondylar eminence (P = 0.0267 and 0.0188, respectively). The narrowed intercondylar notch, expressed by the low Notch Width Index, and the increased size of the intercondylar eminence were identified as the risk factors for the ACL rupture in children.
