We aimed to investigate the role of genetics in the respiratory response of asthmatic children to air pollution, with a genome-wide level analysis of gene by nitrogen dioxide (NO
We used a two-step method for fast linear mixed model computations for genome-wide association studies, exploring whether variants modify the longitudinal relationship between 4-month average pollution and post-bronchodilator FEV
Two SNPs near the EPHA3 (rs13090972 and rs958144) and one in TXNDC8 (rs7041938) showed significant interactions with NO
The host lung function response to long-term exposure to pollution is linked to genes involved in cellular adhesion, oxidative stress, inflammatory, and metabolic pathways.
