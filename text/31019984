Lateral patellar dislocations account for 2% to 3% of total knee injuries, especially in adolescents. Depending on the anatomic abnormality contributing to lateral patellar instability, medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction (MPFLR) and/or tibial tubercle osteotomy (TTO) may be indicated.
To assess the risk of adverse events (AEs) after TTO, MPFLR, and concomitant MPFLR and TTO.
Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.
Patients who underwent MPFLR, TTO, and concomitant MPFLR and TTO between 2005 and 2016 were identified through the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database. Medical complications (eg, surgical site infection and deep vein thrombosis), readmission rates, and extended hospital stay within 30 days of the procedure were recorded. Outcomes were compared with bivariate and multivariate Poisson regression.
Out of 882 patients, 617 (70.0%) underwent isolated MPFLR, 170 (19.3%) underwent TTO, and 95 (10.8%) underwent concomitant MPFLR and TTO. The operative time for concomitant MPFLR and TTO was significantly longer (122 ± 45 minutes) compared with isolated MPFLR (97 ± 55 minutes; 
While concomitant MPFLR and TTO significantly increased operative time, there was no difference in the rate of AEs, extended hospital stay, and readmissions within 30 days after isolated MPFLR, isolated TTO, and concomitant MPFLR and TTO.
