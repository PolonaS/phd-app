Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a potentially life-threatening adverse reaction of heparin. Laboratory evaluation of HIT is often not available within a reasonable time. We evaluated the HemosIL
Following determination of the LIA's reference interval and cutoff values, a multicenter study was conducted between March 2013 and June 2015. Plasma samples of HIT-suspected patients (n = 632) were collected and evaluated by LIA on the ACL TOP
Based on the 95% reference interval for healthy donors and HIT-negative patients, a LIA value ≥1.0 U/mL was interpreted positive. The overall agreement of LIA versus EIA and SRA results were 90% (95% CI 88%-92%) and 79% (95% CI 75%-82%), respectively. The negative predictive value for LIA and EIA was comparable (87%) with SRA. The positive and negative percent agreements with the clinical probability were 89% (95% CI 69%-97%) and 86% (95% CI 83%-89%), respectively, with a negative predictive value of 99.6% (95% CI 98%-100%).
Overall, the LIA results were comparable to those of EIA and SRA. This fully automated assay with a remarkable short analytical turnaround time of <20 minutes can be performed on-demand, which would greatly facilitate more prompt management of HIT.
