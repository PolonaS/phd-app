Physical activity is vital for human health. Musculoskeletal injury may inhibit adults from participating in physical activity, and this amount may be less than adults without a history of musculoskeletal injury.
Do individuals with a history of ankle or knee musculoskeletal injury participate in less objectively measured physical activity compared to healthy controls?
Four studies were included. Two studies concluded patients who have undergone an ACL reconstruction (ACLR) spent less time in moderate to vigorous physical activity levels (MVPA) when compared to healthy controls, but still achieved the daily recommended amount of physical activity. One study determined that participants with CAI took less steps per day compared to the control group. The fourth study determined patients with patellofemoral pain were less physically active than healthy controls as they took less steps per day and spent less time participating in mild and high activity.
There is consistent, high quality evidence that demonstrates individuals with a history of ankle or knee musculoskeletal injury participate in less objectively measured physical activity compared to healthy individuals.
Due to nature of study designs of the included articles in this CAT we recommend a grade of 3B.
