Experiencing conflict and displacement can have a negative impact on an individual's mental health. Currently, prevalence of mental health disorders (MHDs) at the primary care level in post-conflict areas within the Northern Province of Sri Lanka is unknown. We aimed to explore this prevalence in conflict-affected populations attending primary care, using a structured package of validated screening tools for MHDs.
This cross-sectional study aimed to determine factors related to mental health disorders at the primary care level in Northern Province, Sri Lanka. A structured interview was conducted with internally displaced adults attending 25 randomly selected primary care facilities across all districts of Northern Sri Lanka (Jaffna, Mannar, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya). Participants were screened for depression, anxiety, psychosis, PTSD, and somatoform symptoms.
Among 533 female and 482 male participants (mean age 53.2â€‰years), the prevalence rate for any MHD was 58.8% (95% CI, 53.8-61.4), with 42.4% screening positive for two or more disorders (95% CI, 38.6-46.1). Anxiety prevalence was reported at 46.7% (95% CI, 41.9-51.5), depression at 41.1% (95% CI, 38.7-44.5), PTSD at 13.7% (95% CI, 10.6-16.8), somatoform symptoms at 27.6% (95% CI, 23.6-31.5), and psychosis with hypomania at 17.6% (95% CI, 13.3-21.9).
This is the first study at the primary care level to investigate prevalence of MHDs among conflict-affected populations in the Northern Province, Sri Lanka. Results highlight unmet mental health needs in the region. Training intervention to integrate mental health services into primary care is planned.
