To investigate whether single femoral, single tibial tunnel anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is equal to or superior to double femoral, double tibial tunnel ACL double-bundle anatomic reconstruction in terms of restoring the stability and functions of the knee joint.
A prospective clinical study was performed to compare 30 cases of single-tunnel ACL double-bundle anatomic reconstruction to 28 cases of double-tunnel ACL double-bundle anatomic reconstruction, with average follow-up of 36 months. All graft tendons were hamstring tendon autografts. Tunnel placements in all the cases were made anatomically. Clinical results were collected after reconstruction. Graft appearance, meniscus status and cartilage state under arthroscopy were compared and analyzed.
Tunnel placements were in the anatomic positions in both groups. On the lateral pivot-shift test performed at 36 months postoperatively, there was no significant difference between groups. Clinical results such as International Knee Documentation Committee score, Tegner activity scale, and range of motion showed no significant differences between the groups. The mean thickness of anteromedial graft was reduced by 10.3% and that of the posterolateral graft was reduced by 11.1% from the original graft thickness evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. No new meniscal tears were found either group; however, cartilage damage occurred in the double-tunnel group at 39.3%, and this rate was significantly higher than that in the single-tunnel group (10.0%).
Single femoral, single tibial tunnel anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction has the same effectiveness as the double femoral, double tibial tunnel in restoring the knee's stability and functions.
