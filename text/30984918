Sarcopenia is defined as an age-related loss of muscle mass and strength which impairs physical function leading to disability and frailty. Resistance exercises are effective treatments for sarcopenia and are critical in mitigating weight-loss induced sarcopenia in older adults attempting to lose weight. Yet, adherence to home-based regimens, which is a cornerstone to lifestyle therapies, is poor and cannot be ascertained by clinicians as no objective methods exist to determine patient compliance outside of a supervised setting. Our group developed a Bluetooth connected resistance band that tests the ability to detect exercise repetitions. We recruited 6 patients aged 65 years and older and recorded 4 specific, physical therapist-led exercises. Three blinded reviewers examined the findings and we also applied a peak Ending algorithm to the data. There were 16.6 repetitions per exercise across reviewers, with an intraclass correlation of 0.912 (95%CI: 0.853-0.953, p<0.001) between reviewers and the algorithm. Using this novel resistance band, we feasibly detected repetition of exercises in older adults.
