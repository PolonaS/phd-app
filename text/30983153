Increasing evidence indicates that osteoarthritis (OA) is a musculoskeletal disease affecting the whole joint, including both cartilage and subchondral bone. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been demonstrated to be one of the important destructive factors during early-stage OA development. The objective of this study was to investigate isorhamnetin (Iso) treatment on osteoclast formation and chondrocyte protection to attenuate OA by modulating ROS. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) was used to establish the osteoclast differentiation model in bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) in vivo. H
